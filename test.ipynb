      "Okay. Okay, everybody. How you doing? It's Friday. It's Friday for a lot of you. I know that's what you live for. Congratulations. It's September the 29th, Friday, option expiry day 2023 coming to you live from Vienna, Austria. Jennifer and I welcome all of you to the to the broadcast. Glad you're here. Just so you those of you don't know. This is what the neighborhood looks like where we are right now. This is kind of what it looks like. These have these buildings around us are sort of four or five, six stories tall. Old downtown Vienna. Now, to be fair, a lot of these buildings were built many years ago, but they've they've gone through renovations over the years. Pretty well. I mean, every single business establishment that is located in these buildings, they have air conditioning. We're not talking about, you know, buildings from the 1700s that are powered up by coal at night, or need wood in the fireplace to keep you warm. I mean, these are modern electric, you know, efficient buildings. These buildings have been renovated all of them over time. I'm sure building codes in Vienna are strict. I do we do see Jen and I cranes around here, where an old building is so far gone. That has to come down. It just it just has to come down now. Maybe they preserve the outside of the building, take it away, you know, got the middle of it, and then rebuild a new structure and put the new put the old front back on the new structure to make it look like that, which I think that's great. It's economically feasible. But these buildings then have the latest wiring, the latest plumbing, the latest air conditioning, the latest solar power panels, or whatever, you know, and they're very modern. It's very interesting city to be in here. This is the capital of Austria. So you have the parliament here, you have all the embassies around the world and the Vienna capital, the capital of Vienna is for world leaders a very important place a lot, a lot of government to government negotiations take place in Vienna, because if there's a, an issue that one country wants to talk to another one about, in a calm in a quiet way without, you know, local press, you're not going to do it in your home country's capital, you're not going to do it in the other home country's capital. Why don't we have our embassy people get together in Vienna, where we have embassies at a neutral country, you know, it's kind of like, it's kind of like Bannon in Switzerland, or why don't we meet in Geneva, you know, let's meet in Berlin. But meeting here in Vienna, you can conduct a lot of business between countries. And sometimes there's three or four countries that have to have a chat with each other. And so you know, government officials from each country get together and they meet at, you know, the government office here in Vienna that isn't associated with any of the four countries, it's associated with Austria only. And it's a neutral place with no reporters, no interference, no cameras, have a chat. This is that, that's the kind of town we're in. It's a powerful, powerful city. But it's under the radar. It doesn't. It's not like New York City, where they go, we're here, we're New York, baby. We're not like that at all. It's very common. A lot of business gets done here between corporations between companies and countries. And anyway, I find it interesting. I'm glad you're doing I hope you're doing well out there. Welcome all. Happy expiry day. Exactly. The week has gone so quick. Thank you to DeepValue and to LameDuck and Robert. How you doing, buddy? Richard, Flint, Creek, Mandu. Good morning, everybody. Manager, thank you. Drew. DeepValue, Lizzie, how are you doing there? Nautilorker, number 23 thumbs ups. Thank you for sharing on Discord. What else is going on? Chase Rosita Parker is here. Good morning. Thank you for these first thing in the morning thumbs ups. Appreciate it. It's 2.35 in the afternoon here in Vienna. Going to be an 80 degree day today. Calm, no wind, sunny, amazing. They do get winter here. But you know, today it's nice. Cindy B. Good morning. JJ. Good morning, manager. I am having login issues with Discord today. Anyone experienced the same? Apparently, yes. That apparently there is issues there. But I only heard this through other comments. I don't know anything about it myself. Welcome to the program. We've got a positive start, I think, to the market, it would appear. All morning, we've got a gain. Now in Europe, having a good day here. Germany, France, UK, Italy, all the big markets are up nicely here, almost like a one percentage or more gain for the most part. In the futures market in the US, we're up a half a percentage point on the Dow and the S&P 500. But we're up almost three quarters of a percentage point on NASDAQ. And these markets are improving as the morning continues on. So, so far, so very good for the US markets. Oil in Texas is up $1.23 to $92.94. So we've got that $91.93, $94 range going right now in Texas on oil. Yesterday, the Dow gained 116 points in America when it was all said and done. And the market yesterday was pretty well positive, right after 10 o'clock in the morning, almost all day long. The Dow could have been up over 200 points, but it couldn't hold those kinds of gains. But it was a good day, an okay day yesterday. It was better. We've been oversold this week. And so the markets are kind of, you know, reacting to it to sort of pop up a little bit. There could be another update today. On the basis that we had an update yesterday, there might be more momentum today to go even higher. Maybe. We're at $17 on GameStop. That's up 16 cents. We have been at $17.08 today already. So a little gain there. Apparently a memo leaked, I guess. I guess that's the only way to say it. There was an internal memo from Mr. Cohen to the employees, talking about the fact that now that he is the CEO, President, CEO, Chairman of the Board, he happened to mention in the memo that, look, I'm paraphrasing this. Okay. I'm just, you know, talking in my own speak here. Basically what he said is, kids, I'm not getting paid a dime to do any of this. Okay. The only way I make money personally is if the stock goes up. Because that's the only thing I've got in this company that makes me a richer guy. He doesn't need a salary to do the job at GameStop. He's not looking for a day job. He's a billionaire. All right. So his upside is stock. The stock goes up in value. He does well. I guess in theory, you could say his ultimate win. I mean, the ultimate, ultimate win for a guy like Ryan Cohen is that a larger company buys out GameStop from existing shareholders on a takeover. But there's no way that's going to happen right now. No way. There's no interested party that wants to buy GameStop that I'm aware of, unless I'm missing something really obvious. I just get the impression that Mr. Cohen is saying, look, I believe in this company, and I think we can make it make money. And one way we can make it make money is to not have it waste money. All right. So if we cut our expenses down and run this corporation for what it really is, which is a brick and mortar shopping mall, strip mall, retailer, we run it well. This company can make money. We don't need to have a fancy corporate jet. We don't need to have a fancy head office. We don't need to have, you know, highfalutin, high paid people with a bunch of perks. We can run this company in a lean and mean fashion. And I want you to think about the money that we are spending here as if it's your money. And you know what he's saying, you know, in a backhanded kind of way, it's your job on the line. Because if we don't make money by not cutting back, we don't cut back properly. We have to let people go. And if we let people go, it might be you. So kids, we run this company like it can be run, we can do some, we can make some dough here. And there's a gift being handed to GameStop, along with any other company out there that has cash in the bank. And that is interest income. And these guys have 1.2 billion in cash, and they're going to haul in at least I am thinking at least 60 million a year in interest, at least. It could be more if rates go even higher.\n",
      "year. So $60 million a year, $1.2 million a week being handed to the company in cash for no risk. You can do that with a two-year treasury note at 5.1% right now. So if they break even as a corporation operationally, they'll still make $60 million a year in profit just off the interest on their money. Now if they can run the company in such a way that they add $100 million to $200 million a year in fresh cash into their balance sheet and earn interest on a larger pot of cash every year, well then it gets better faster. The next five years could be very profitable for the company. They may be pulling in $70, $80, $100 million a year in interest. It depends on how high interest rates want to go. But higher interest rates mean tougher times for consumers, which means maybe a tougher time at the cash register of every GameStop store. It's a back and forth, isn't it? Their number one way of growing that company is to cut expenses as much as they possibly can and be a lean and mean corporation. Service the customer at the cash register, which I know is a big deal for Ryan Cohn. He has out and out said it. Out service everybody in competition with that company. Get their loyal clients to buy from GameStop's website and on site. Cut expenses to the bone and make money and add the interest income on top of it all. And if they can pull in $300 million a year in profits, that's $1 a share. And $1 a share in profit is to me a $20, $30 stock, $20, $30 PE. Now, if you can pull this thing into $400, $500, $600 million over the next year or two in net profits, you're talking $2 a share. And at $20, $30 times earnings, that's $40 to $60 a share. Ryan Cohn has an incentive to get the stock to $60 a share. Millions of incentive reasons. He has a lot of stock. Well, everyone else who owns stock will be a happy camper if this were to take place. The question then is, if this company can generate a half a billion a year in profit running a lean and mean operation, could they either be a takeover target or could they be a buyer of somebody else? I don't know. That's the big round around we go. There you have it. I am doing what I can. All right. Let's see. Welcome Luca, my friend. Ciao everybody. 172 from last night rerun. I'm ready for today's action. Manager, not a lurker. I thought the response I sent to Beachboy made discord mad at me or something. So I deleted the message. I hope that many got to read it. Joshua, anyone see dumb money yet? Saw it last night. Thumbs up says Joshua. Is America closing today? That's what we don't know, Bobby. We're going to find out here later if Congress can keep it open. Not a lurker. Manager, I thought you deleted it. I wanted to read it again and it was gone. Tiff sent out an alert about discord issues. Deep value options. Forbes valuation. Cohen has a net worth of $3.2 billion. And as of Thursday was the world's 918th richest person. Posted 23 hours ago by Forbes. Very interesting. He's what, 35 years old? Deep value. Forbes valuation. Cohen has a net worth of $3.2 billion as of Thursday. Deep value. Dumb money was a fun movie. I just wish they had talked about Ryan Cohen instead of focusing on Wall Street bets as much. I forgot that they had shut down Wall Street bets for a bit back in January of 2021. Yeah. Like I say, there were a lot of shenanigans going on back then. And no one went to jail. Nobody got charged. Nobody got fined. Nothing. Nothing. SEC did nothing. Nope. Not a thing. And here we are. But the company itself is cash rich. Non-existent really. And I think they're making money right now. I personally think GameStop is profitable. We're about to find out the next quarter shortly. By the way, this is Friday, September 29th, as I mentioned. Tomorrow's the 30th, last day of the month. Monday, we're into October, kids. And in about two weeks, two and a half weeks, guess what? Earnings season for the third quarter will come through here. We're going to find out how everyone is doing and away we go. Of course, GameStop will not release any financials for their quarter until much later. Because we only just got their numbers, what, a month ago? Two more months, at least. OK. Manager says, OK, I'm going to repost it as soon as Discord comes back. Larry Titus, good morning, everybody. I am number 46 on Bruce's thumbs up meter. Thank you, Allaire. We have 49 now going. Appreciate you all being here today. Welcome to the party, everybody. It's nice to see you here. OK. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein dies at age 90. Report just coming out, just coming through. Like I have said a billion freaking times, these senators and these governors and these dictators around the world, they get carried out in a body bag. They never, ever quit. They don't retire. They get carried out in a body bag. And others are dead people walking. And Mitch McConnell is one of them and many others. And it's amazing how Dianne Feinstein, with her declining health in the last two years, would not give it up. It's just ridiculous. Now, the good news for the Democrats is that Dianne Feinstein is from California. The governor of California is a Democrat. So guess what? He gets to nominate a senator at the moment to fill her seat. Do you think that he's going to nominate a Democrat to fill her seat? I would say so. And so there you go. No changes in the Senate splits with that regard. But next year, November, Dianne Feinstein's seat, I'm going to guess, will it come up or will it not? I'm trying to remember. It was up anyway. It was up for re-election. So she was trying to wait out the term until next year. Now they'll nominate someone to fill the term out. And the campaign for senator is underway. And there are all kinds of people who've declared this. We'll see what happens. All right. Manager, I hope I get to dump my cash secure puts on the Tesla run-up. Coffee kids trading. I'm number 50. Mandu number five. Wow. Miracle. There you go. Wow. Miracle. All right. We'll see what's going on. By the way, I want to mention to those of you who are here right now, there are different viewers watching me at the moment. There are my Gold Bagel members, these guys. There are my Children with Uncle Bruce members. So all the members of my channel, a number of you are here. Thank you. Appreciate it. There are subscribers who are just subscribers. There are folks who don't do anything. They just watch me from time to time. They come and they go. I appreciate you. The lurkers and so welcome. I wanted to mention. And again, it's early days, so forgive me if I don't come off sounding all full of myself, but it's been about two weeks now that I have been uploading daily trading tips for Gold Bagel members of this channel. It's been about not almost about two weeks. And in the last 10 days or so, I've really focused on the trading tips where I'm going a lot more conservative than aggressive, especially on Iron Condors. I did mention one day about the dip in Rocket Lab when it had that drop off after that failed launch. I told folks under $4 buy that stock and a bunch of you did. And I'm glad to hear you will be well rewarded over time. There's no doubt in my mind. But I've done a lot of Iron Condor commentary on these trading tips since I started these trading tips. And in the last week and a half, I have I have really gone where I've been recommending Iron Condors where the calls are way up here relative to the market and the puts on the Condors are way down here. So there's a huge gap between calls and puts for Iron Condor writers. And I'm happy to report it looks very much like the last week and a half's recommendations are coming together quite nicely. And if any of you out there are doing OK, not doing OK, let me know. Certainly those of some of you just let me know privately through emails, but you can always talk to us here. But I'm hoping that a number of you are finding the Condors are working out for you and that we're just going to keep them coming. We did another tip today, a trading tip today for Gold Bagel members on putting together another Iron Condor. And I think today's trading tip could become quite a winner for a number of you if you take advantage of it. The key here for me is, look, I know if you're a Gold Bagel member, you are paying $25 a month to be part of this channel, which is a very generous commitment to be a member of a YouTube channel. I am turning around and saying, all right, you make a commitment to YouTube and myself.\n",
      "with this membership, I'm gonna make a commitment to you to help you make way more than that on some of these updates and some of these trading recommendations. And so, hopefully in the last week and a half, some of you have picked off some real nice trades here. And I'm curious in the next week or two or three, how they all work out, because a number of these condors are a month long, where I'm expecting you to be involved for like a week and a half to three weeks on these, and then you'll unwind them and take your dough, move on. You keep me posted how you're doing on those trades. Thank you everybody for being here. What else is going on here? BP says, dumb money just focused on deep, whatever, a value of what we're in kitty and Wall Street bets and hedge fund Melbourne capital with a little of Citadel, but not a lot. How billions were loaned by Citadel and co to bail out Melbourne before its collapse. Kelly Haston is in the house. How are you Kelly? Nice to see you here. It's great to have you. Welcome to the show, the channel. BP, not much mentioned on Ryan Cohen and plans. Marty says lucky, I think it's lurker here. And I've been since the beginning, I've been a lurker. Thank you, Marty, for following me here. Splayer, I'm here as well. And good morning, you're all welcome my friend. Deep value options. I'm sure Ken Griffin had it removed from the movie script, blaming the short squeeze on something outside the deep value fundamentals of GameStop. I'm looking for the article that talked the edit or whatever, Alberto, good morning. Bagel familiar, good morning, Alberto. Nice to see you here this morning. We can now begin BP. They left it with Vlad and the attendant of Citadel. Melbourne updates to the Senate, but roaring kitty summed up the Senate was great and really worth watching and echoing. He's the only guy that would answer questions with a yes or no answer when they asked him, can you give us an answer? Yes or no? Do you like the stock? Yes. Are you intending on continuing to invest in it? Will you be buying more? Yes. That's the only one he would do it. Everyone else is saying it. I'm so glad to be here. I'm so, so appreciate the question. And America has been so good to me and my family. Why don't you answer the damn question? Shut the hell up. Matthew, number 54. Good morning, folks. A lot of good news coming out this morning. White Feather, I've been writing four and five day iron condors on SPX. It has worked very well so far. They did not pay enough attention in the movie to Robin Hood turning off the buy button. I know. All the shenanigans going on and everything else. Unbelievable. Yeah, there's a knock on the door. What else is going on? Hang on one second here. Okay, hang on one second, folks. We're going to be with you in a moment or two or three or four. If we can. Just one second, please. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi there. When you're in a hotel, when the room service, you know, when they come by, you need towels? Yeah, we need towels. So sorry about that, but we're good, we're good. All right. Yes, the shenanigans regarding the, you know, the Citadel and the whole thing. Oh my God, you know, what can I say? Anyway, there you go. Thank you all. And what we got here? Splare, I bet that money too will be about Ryan Cohen. They mentioned, it was like two minutes, says Joshua. Splare squeezing all of our entertainment money out. Constantine, good morning, everybody. Number 57 says, Splare, what a beautiful view. Lorraine, good morning, I'm number 59. I see Mozart, says Flint Creek. Richard, oh, Vienna food is getting to Uncle Bruce. Alex, number 59, good morning, everybody. Another sunny day here in Manchester, UK. Larry, is that picture taken in Austria? Yes, it is. That is the neighborhood in which we're in here. Charlie, oh, Uncle Bruce getting swatted again. Run, Bruce, run. Deep value, they should have added Uncle B because he was the only one not actually helping Wall Street Bets when they came to his channel. He was the only one out there actually helping Wall Street Bets when they came to his channel. I know I did get interviewed by a number of people during the hype of this, the height of the craziness, January, February, March of 2021. I did get a few interviews where I was talking over the phone with certain people, but I do not know if anyone that I talked to had anything to do with this project or not. I really don't know. I may have been interviewed by people who are trying to write a screenplay or thinking about it or maybe trying to do a documentary and maybe I've already done others. I don't know. I've never been officially thanked by anyone or not officially contacted to say, hey, listen, here's a link to a documentary. We use some of your, you know, what you told us about what was going on and we verified it or whatever. I remember hearing back from anyone on any of this. It was a crazy time and my phone was ringing off the hook and my email was going crazy and it was nuts. I mean, it was nuts. So I never did hear anything from anyone. I lived the dumb money life like you did. I went through it from this angle and you went through it from your angle and I can just say, happily say, I'm still on the air. I'm still here. I never bought and sold the stock. I never got involved in that. I shifted my channel from just being a, you know, a plain English only what's going on in the market channel into more of a plain English, understand the technicals, understand the emotions of the channel and talk to you about derivatives, options and how can you take advantage of this market when no one knows what the hell's going on and what's gonna go on, where you are watching and following what's happening in the market and you are like me, noticing that certain people can get away with interesting transactions and others cannot and there's gotta be a way for the little guy, someone with less than, you know, $20 million to make a living in this market and there's gotta be a way for people who have virtually nothing to get a leg up and become better traders and there's gotta be a way for those of you out there who are either close to retirement and have very little to show for it or halfway to retirement and need all the help you can get to build a portfolio or you're brand new in this market and you don't know what the hell to do because you can't go anywhere for advice because you don't have enough money to get advice. You found me, I found you, here we are, two and a half years later, almost three years later. I mean, I'm on the air now over three years on this channel but live, January 2021, every day, here we are. We've come a long way, haven't we? And I'm very excited for how many of you are benefiting from this interaction back and forth with me and with each other, it's fantastic. Don't forget, October 21, that is coming up, not even, just barely three weeks from now, three weeks from, is it tomorrow? Am I dreaming here? It's the 29th of September, tomorrow's the 30th of September. It's 21st of October, I keep talking about the get together. Three weeks, Jennifer and I will be in New Jersey, in Secaucus, New Jersey at the Harmony Suites Hotel, which used to be a, it used to be a Embassy Suites, you see how I can't remember? It used to be an Embassy Suites Hotel in Secaucus, New Jersey it still operates but it's now called, without her, I wouldn't know where the hell I am. She's my Google. We're having a meet and greet there and I look forward to seeing you. About 20 already of you, at least 20 have already said, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. So there's gonna be 20 plus of you already. Any of you would like to join us, come on by and say hi. That'll be.\n",
      "a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to it and you know, that's the end of our trip kind of thing. We're just finishing it off in New Jersey and then we head home on the, was it the Tuesday? We take off back to Calgary, Calgary, Cowtown. Awesome stuff. Absolutely nice. Constantine, when we write a condor, does that mean that whatever the risk amount is, that chunk of money has to be blocked in the account until they close the condor? It depends on your platform. What are their exact rules and you know, the way they set it up. Generally speaking, I say, look, if you are going to write a condor and you have a $5 spread between the put that you wrote and the put you bought and a $5 spread between the call you wrote and the call you bought. That's a $500 spread on the top of the bottom. If you brought in $150 credit against that, you have a $350 net risk on the trade. That's all you're at. That's all you're risking, $350 for one position. Now you write 10 of those, create 10 condors, it's $3,500. But the gross amount is $5,000, that spread. You can control that spread. You can make it higher or lower, up to you. Certain platforms will dictate that they want protection. They want coverage for that risk. And they might not care what your credit is. They might insist that on all $5 or whatever that spread is, that's what they want you to have, either marginability or credit. I don't know. So you've got to look into it yourself. Okay. All right. Matthew, I remember when GameStop did the second squeeze after the Senate hearing and Uncle Bruce said, I think you buy. Mondew, it's a Jersey thing. Deepish, Mulan Automotive, way to go. Spur, how quick time is running? Matthew, I remember when GameStop did the second squeeze after the Senate. I got introduced to Bruce through Matt Kaur's channel where Uncle Bruce was talking GameStop. I was interviewed by Matt. I was interviewed by Trace Trades. I was asked to appear on a couple of other channels which I didn't do because I wasn't too keen on how they were doing what they were doing. But yeah, that was a crazy time. It really was. Flint Creek, just thinking about cashmere for the meat. Got to make a fresh batch for the soap here. Hope that's okay. Absolutely. You betcha. Make a fresh batch of cashmere soap. There will be fans there. I'm looking forward to how you folks react to each other. I will be recognizing faces at this meet and greet because a number of you who are coming out to see us, I've done one-on-ones with you. So I may or may not recognize some of you. But we're looking forward to it. Jen and I are excited. Splatter, I have to come up with hundreds of dollars for every dollar between those spread trades. Normally to all brokers, for example, 24 right and 26 buy, 200 to wait till it's closed up. That sounds about right. Flint Creek, yeah, people should be incentivized now. We got cashmere coming. Jewels, Matt's great and he's still on. He is. Didn't he move? Was it Matt that was the one who, I can't remember exactly who was what, but was it Matt that moved to Puerto Rico? I think he moved there for tax reasons, probably in 2022. I'm not 100% sure, but yeah, there's a few that are still on the air, but many that aren't. Isn't it interesting? John Biscuit is asking me a loaded question. Is Biden still the greatest president of all time? No, that was Max, says Jewels. Max was the guy that moved to Puerto Rico. Interesting. Well, what do you think? Do you think Biden is the greatest president of all time? I'll put it to you this way. That is such a generic statement that that isn't fair to anybody. Is he doing an okay job with the unemployment rate or nothing he does is credited to him for that? Is it his fault that there's inflation rather than the world having inflation? He started it. Is it his fault that Americans hate each other or did they hate each other before he got there? Is it Biden's fault that that crime is the way it is? I mean, I think it depends who you ask, isn't it? I think it is. Anyway, you guys make up your own minds. You demand Uncle Bruce. Oh, thank you. Credit Savage. Good morning, folks, fellow degenerates and simpletons. Hope you're all having a good day. I haven't seen you in a while. Welcome to the show. Nice to have you here. Welcome to the party. Been a while. Splare, are you still just liking the president who's doing a good job, not related to Democrats or Republicans? Matthew, I wonder what happened to Trey's trades. Yeah. Trey and a number of others disappeared very quickly within like a month or two of each other. Yeah, I think there are underlying issues out there that are that that came home to roost. Maybe. I don't know. I've heard I've heard things, but I can't justify them. And I'm not that guy. I'm not the expert. I'm not the guy investigating this. I don't know. I'm just doing what I'm doing. And that's it. Anyway, there it is. Thank you all. Interesting. Anyway, folks, I'm not going to not going to bother with these other comments. I'm just I'm just here doing what I do with the folks that that I love hanging out with. And I'm every week, every month. I am blown away by by how your trading has changed, how your outlook to the markets have been completely transformed. If you've taken my classes and been with me on one on ones and you hang out with me here every day, it is obvious the kinds of questions you ask me now about the markets are not even remotely similar to the kind of questions I used to answer two years ago. Things have really, really changed around here. This channel is so different than what we were in 2021. But then again, what do you want two and a half years down the road? Yeah, we, you know, kind of learned a few things. And here we are. Right. That's that's it. Waverly, I am number 69 today. Welcome to the show, everybody. Thank you for these thumbs ups. 71 are in the house now. And I appreciate you all very, very much. It's great to have you here. You know, Splatter is saying a pretty good point here. As long as you don't have a dictator running your area, it's all fine. I'm with you there. Can you speak about the market oversold position and the economics that might spur this market higher? Could you do that? Oh, I would love to. Yes, I really would. Yes, I do believe we have a we do have a market that is a whole bunch oversold right now. We're almost off 2000 points at one point from the high of the year. We've come down, you know, a fair amount. There are reasons for the market to be doing what it's doing. Certainly. And I will say that you may recall back in May and June when the markets were going higher and higher and higher, I was cautioning people that, hey, this, you know, this might not last so long. We may want to be careful about, you know, what's going on here. We may want to be mindful of the fact that this market is a little more exuberant than maybe it should be in the economic circumstances that we're finding ourselves in right now, especially with these inflation numbers and these interest rate figures and other issues. And so the stock market, you know, it had a good run. A little too\n",

      "far too fast for, you know, for me. But guess what? Things have backed off. And so here we are now, you know, with a market that may have come back a little too far too fast. Well, you know what? This is the stock market, kids. In a microcosm, markets don't make sense sometimes. They get out of whack. And public opinion is expressed by buy and sell orders. And too many folks get exuberant. They go nuts. Too many folks get pessimistic. It goes the other direction badly. And so there you go. There's welcome to the world. I don't know. What can I say? Secaucus, BW Dammit, I booked into Hackensack, heard that from Lex Luthor, that was a beautiful place to visit, visiting the tech, the tech marchers, a manager. Did Michael Burry close his put positions? I don't know. I know who Michael Burry is, but I don't know if he did or not. Wasn't Michael Burry calling for a major, major dump off?\n",
      "what we have here. We do not have a market that has gone ridiculously too low. I think we've just gone a little too low for the moment. Michael Burry, I think was calling for a lot lower market than this. So I don't know if he's done yet. Can't speak for him. He doesn't return my calls. Matter of fact, I've never tried to call him. So, you know, there's no way to know. Anybody out there talk to him on a regular basis? Well, let us know what you hear. Appreciate it. Anyway, there you go. Welcome to the party, everybody. Nice to have you here. We're 19 minutes away from opening for the day. We're gonna see what this market has in store for us. Thank you all for, well, 75 thumbs up so far. Appreciate that. I see indications here of an up day. I've got the market right now. Let's take a look here. We've got futures in the Dow up 220. That's the best level of the morning. 31 point gain on S&P, that's 0.71%. NASDAQ up 143, almost a full percentage point. Oil's still up a dollar for a barrel. So that's good stuff. US trade deficit in goods shrinks 7.3%. That might give a small lift to the GDP. Interesting stuff. Interest rates right now, 4.52 on the 10-year, which is the low of the day at the moment. And the US dollar is still down a tiny bit on the pound and the euro, and a little bit on the yen, I think. Reports are out there. Senator, Democratic Senator from California has passed away at age 90. Those are the reports making headlines right now. Manager October is the next month. Waverly, Michael Burry has been right before. Touch grass, Burry's a bear trader. He's always planning for it. Waverly, he has also been wrong many, many, many, many times. Karen, good morning. I am number 62 on the Thumbs Up Universe. Welcome, Karen, to the show and the channel. I am showing right now pre-market. Rocket Lab up about 10 cents at 4.44 a share, way under priced, in my humble opinion. We got SoFi up 15 to 7.92. Looks like we're taking a run at eight bucks this morning. GameStop is up 18 cents, 17.02 right now. Matterport is up a nickel, 23andMe up a penny or so. I've got SmartRent down maybe six cents. Apple is up 193, holding again all morning. Goldman up $2.56. Cisco's up 21 to 54.10. We got Tesla up 4.34 on top of the 5.88 from yesterday. We got ARK Innovation up 68 cents. Microsoft up 3.10, 3.16, 74 a share. Pfizer's up eight. HPQ is up 18 cents. Alphabet, that's Google, up $1.17 today, up 167 yesterday. Amazon is up 229. Nvidia is nicely higher, $7.47 to 4.38. We got Unity up 50 cents. C3.AI Inc. or AI up 62 cents, 25 cents. Adobe up 403 to 508.71. We got Netflix up 421 to 380 bucks. The Spiders are up 290. The Triple Qs are up 351. That seems to be part of the initial early morning trend trades at the moment with the Dow holding a fairly good gain here, 218 points in the pre-market with 16 minutes to go. 30 on S&P, 140 on NASDAQ, but all three are less than one percentage point higher. Nonetheless, it's a game. There you have it. Crude oil up 92 cents at $92.63 so far this morning. Welcome all to this show. And that's what I'm seeing right now. We'll follow the opening as we get going and see what's going on. Hector number 76. Hector, thank you very much. I think what we might need to do here is to let the Knights of Ni know that even though we're not yet trading officially, we honor their existence on this channel and we let the Knights of Ni know that we are aware of their presence and the power that they have. JR knows. Neat, neat, neat. Richard Carlin knows. Neat, neat, neat. Manager knows. Neat, neat, neat, neat, neat, neat. Here come the Ni emojis. All over this channel, 80 thumbs ups and counting. Ni emojis from Constantine. Maria Powell is on it. Here come the emojis and here come other emojis sliding up the side there. That's not cool. JR, good morning, everybody. I'm number 80. Welcome JR to the show. DH Ruta is in the house. Karen is watching. Matthew is here. They all know the power that the Ni emoji brings. Edith, the big E is here. Idiot, I can't pronounce the big E. Luca, thank you, Luca. Neat, neat, neat, neat. Octavio. Neat, neat, neat, neat. Flynn Creek. Neat, neat, neat, neat, neat. That's right. Don't think this channel doesn't know who we have to honor and pay attention to. We're not crazy. You know, we're wise and that's why we make money on this channel. We know who to honor. We're a cult, our cult leader. We just have to ask. The Ni emoji attack is underway. And here come all these emojis sliding up the side there. Hector is on it. Splare is on it. Neat, neat, neat, neat, neat. It's Friday, everybody. Welcome to Friday. Oh yeah, man. I love it. Nice to see you all here. Thank you for joining us from Vienna, Austria. Fab, you and us. Yes, indeed. It is quite the place to be. And I gotta say, it is a most interesting place to be hanging out at. We loved it last year. We decided to come back again and enjoy, absolutely enjoy Vienna. It has just been a delight to be here. You never know when you can come back, so why not go? Yeah. Touch grass. Senator Dianne Feinstein just passed. Am I late? That's the word. Maria Powell. Good morning to all. Number 77 thumbs up, says Maria. Thank you for joining us. Nice to have you here. Ni emojis have been dominating the channel in the last few minutes. And yeah, we're gonna see. You know, we know that Gavin Newsom will nominate another person to take over the Senate seat. It'll be a Democrat. Don't worry about it. Control of the Senate is not gonna pass for that reason, but it's another year and a few months before the elections. And so it's gonna be a while before we all find out around here just what the next four years looks like, or at least two years looks like. Hector, when US senators get carried out in the office in body bags, any government should consider term limits. Well, yeah, well, this has been talked about for what, 50 years? It's not gonna happen. It's just too many powerful people have their favorites that they bank all the way. And you know, how many senators wouldn't quit? Unbelievable. And look at Mitch McConnell freezing, freezing on live television. How many times has Mitch frozen in his house in, you know, at home already? How many times? I mean, geez, talk about warning shots across the bow. My God, ridiculous. Touch grass, she was 90, wow. Maria, beautiful fall morning in South Carolina, 66 degrees. You gotta love that. It's gorgeous here, 80 degrees for the high today here in Vienna, gorgeous weather. Been a beautiful week, really nice. It was nice for the most part last week in Berlin, a couple of showers, but all in all, it was nice. Stockholm was nice. And we've enjoyed good weather, generally speaking, on this trip. And so we're very happy about it. Very good and very nice indeed. 1701 on GameStop, that's the story. 1701 on GameStop. And we are looking at a market right now in the futures with a gain here for the Dow of 200 points, 28 on S&P, 136 on NASDAQ at the moment. And crude oil up 79 cents a barrel, 92.50 now on crude oil. Okay, welcome all to the program, the show. We're gonna be live in opening this market in 10 minutes. And we'll just see if this momentum, this positive momentum will carry into the opening and how far will it go. We're about to find out, we'll see for ourselves. At the moment, it looks good. So far up 17 now, 794 on SoFi. GameStop at 1705, up 21 cents over there. So we definitely have some positive momentum building.\n",
      "taking a peek here at the last five days. SoFi was at $7.38 about three days ago. That would have been on Tuesday. And we were at $7.43, $7.42 yesterday. So we're bouncing off the $7.30 level to push $8 around right now. That's good to see. In the last month, we were in the nines just a little while ago here, the 15th, 14th, 15th of September. So coming back to the 8th level, come on back. We haven't seen it since last week. And it would be nice to get more to the 9 and 10 level. We're going to find out just how this works, OK? There are so many articles out on SoFi. It is quite amazing how many are positive, how many are just out now buy this stuff. And others are going, we're not so sure. And I can't understand why anyone would be negative on SoFi with the number of members that they're adding and their deposit numbers growing. These are the ingredients of a company that's growing quickly and will really compound revenues. But there are analysts out there who just aren't buying into it. They're just kind of going, yeah, I know. But you know, I just don't know what else to say. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Old politicians never die. Well, they get carried away. That's about it. Drives me crazy, absolutely crazy. The amount of work that these folks have to do, you might think that politicians are lazy people. But you try to hang out with one for a while. You'll find out how busy they really are. But 90-year-olds, 85-year-olds, come on. But this seems to be the way it is right now in the USA, isn't it? This is an American, uniquely American thing. I mean, in Canada, the prime minister that we've got is 50 now? Is he? Is Justin even 50 years old? The conservative leader who wants to take over, he's in his 40s. The NDP guy, he'll never be prime minister, is in his 40s. So the top three or four politicians that are going to be Canada's prime minister for the next decade are not anywhere near 55 years of age. In Canada, we have a rule. Senators must retire at age 70 or 71. You turn 71, and you have to retire. You cannot be a senator in Canada. Now, they're appointed. They're not elected, which is a good thing. So we don't have another set of bloody elections to worry about. They're just appointed. But they can't serve beyond age 71. So there you go. So we don't have that problem in Canada, that age problem. But for whatever reason, America has just decided to go with fossils in every sense of the word all over the place. How many senators are over 75? It's scary. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Splare, what do you think about writing a spread again on AI? Maybe 28, 30, buy three, four weeks more time against it. I think I mentioned an AI trade just last week for Gold Bagel members. I did a, I thought I did one. And it's still in effect, I think. And I'm sure anyone who took that deal has got to be loving it. Rinse and repeat, I would say. That's the way I would be looking at it. But whatever. Six minutes, and we open up, kids. Six minutes, and we start trading. 90 thumbs ups. Thank you, everybody. We're 10 away from triple digits now. Thank you all. Appreciate it. Keep those coming in. Absolutely wonderful. Thank you for the thumbs ups today. 17.02 on GameStop. 7.82 now on, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 7.94 on SoFi. 7.94. We're pushing for $8 in the pre-market here on SoFi. That's good to see. Come on, SoFi. Come on, GameStop. I have a few viewers that are keenly interested in the upward performance, the positive performance of some of these stocks. Yeah, right. Carnival, the Cruise Line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share at $0.86 versus per share loss of $0.58. FACT consensus of 75. Stock jumped 6%. There you go. Congratulations to Carnival. Trying to make some money there. Lots of challenges that Carnival's faced with right now, for sure. Same with Norwegian and Royal Caribbean. Unfortunately, Carnival, they're making some money per share. They have so many new shares out there now, so many more shares than before. They're going to need a serious rise in these numbers to make any difference, unfortunately. But I wish the Cruise Line's nothing but the best. I mean, I love cruising myself. Jen and I have been on a number of cruises. We love it. But I got to tell you, these Cruise Lines are so in debt with their bankers, bondholders. They need dollars per share per quarter of profits so they can pay down debt. They're not getting anywhere. The debt costs are rising every quarter for these guys because old debt matures. They got to issue new bonds to buy out the old bonds. And the old bonds are 4%. The new bonds are 12%, 8%, 10%. And we're talking billions of dollars in rollovers every year. Look, I'm telling you guys straight out that GameStop has $1.2 billion in cash. And if they can haul in 5% interest on that money, they pull in $60 million a year in money and pure income. Carnival, $20 billion in debt. If they pay 6% more for the debt, that's $1.2 billion a year, $100 million a month in debt increase charges. That wipes out profits quickly, just instantly. And they can't pay it down. They're trying to pay the interest. Just pay the interest. That's not going to solve the problem. You've got to knock off the debt to bring the cost of interest down. Carnival is not in that position, even with this profit. So they've got work to do, definitely. I don't know. I don't know. Maria, I have Tesla 145 cash secured puts expiring today. I'll get out early. Happy not to roll. There you go, right on. Interesting stuff, interesting stuff. We are two minutes away from Larry Titus hitting the bells for us so we can see what this opening looks like here and get a sense of it. At the moment, it looks to me like we have a gain here holding. Let's see, 215 on the Dow Jones. Very good. 2 thirds of a point. 30 point gain on S&P, 0.7. NASDAQ almost a point higher, percentage point higher at 139 points. Crude oil, however, giving up some of the gains. It was up $1.50 this morning, an hour ago. Now it's only up $0.60. 92.34 on crude oil. It looks like it's giving it up a little bit here. The world's second richest man. Here's a headline, LVMH. Bernard Arnault is being investigated over dealings with Russian oligarch reports are being said. So something up there. Friends in high places have other friends in high places globally. And maybe for some prosecutors, that's not comfortable. I don't know. We'll see what happens there. Well, we'll find out. All right, there it is. There it is. We are a minute away from opening. One minute away, everybody. What is gonna happen? Let's find out here in a few moments what is going on. We are at 93 thumbs ups. Thank you all for helping out with that. We appreciate it. 93 thumbs ups and counting. If you're able to hit it, please hit that thumbs up meter for us. Larry has done what he does so well. He has hit the bells for us. Thank you, my friend. We appreciate it. We are open. We're ready to start counting the chips. Option expiry day today. JR Larry is warming up the bells. There they go, baby. We're underway. 214 point gain right off the get-go is what I'm showing mere seconds in. We'll see how strong that rally is and if it has any staying power or not. Slayer, rock on and thanks to that. All right, kids. Welcome. All of you out there to the show, the channel and today's action.\n",
      "a 217 point gain right now for the Dow as we are just starting it off. The S&P is up 30, NASDAQ up 132, that's a full percentage point. Crude is ahead by just 69.70 cents, 92.40, that's what we've got. Right here and right now, Adobe is up a couple of bucks. GameStop is at 17.05 up 21 cents, and we've got SoFi at 8.06 up 29 cents, SoFi right through $8 like a hot knife through soft butter. We've already hit 8.14 this morning on SoFi with 1.4 million volume, SoFi just shot right through $8, $8.06, make it $8.12 right now up 36 cents on your SoFi. Nice to see it bust out of $8 and go right through it, that's a beautiful sign. $17.08 on GameStop, the $17 barrier is not an issue to start the day, $17.09, $8.14 on SoFi. We're running SoFi up a little more and it'll be a 5% gain already. Thank you SoFi, well done. We'll take that action. Go SoFi go, I say, and exactly. Yes indeed, run that thing. Let's see what it's got. All right. The US market right now up 158 on the Dow, 28 on S&P, 128 on NASDAQ with a 62 cent gain on oil. There is the story and I'm sticking to that story, I'm sticking to it. That's what I see right now. Rocket Lab is up 17.7 cents at $4.51, $4.52, $0.35 gain on SoFi, $0.26 gain on GameStop, Matterport up a nickel, 23andMe up a penny, Spire down 15, ATIP down 43 early trades, a SmartRent up one penny, Apple up 157, Goldman up 137, Cisco up 29, Tesla up 284, ARK Innovations up 85 cents, Microsoft up 373, Pfizer up 31 cents, that's a percentage point, HBQ up 19 cents, Google up 36, Amazon up 187. We've got NVIDIA up 638, Unity up 98, AI is up 76 cents, going for 26 bucks, Adobe up 250, Netflix up 370, Spyder's up 263 and Triple Q's up 340, a nice little pop to start the morning is what I have right here right now. We're going to see how this wants to play itself out, 8.10, 8.12 on SoFi, 8.14, this is the high of the day range on SoFi, right here, right now, 8.14, 8.15 on SoFi, high of the day and the volume now on SoFi, what is this now, three minutes into the morning, 2,100,000. GameStop, not much, we're up 30 cents on 124,000 shares. It took nothing to pop a 30 cent gain on GameStop today. Could be some buying coming in because of that memo we talked about this morning about Ryan Cohen telling his staff what he's looking at here. Interesting to watch, up 32 cents, we'll see if it's got some staying power or not. Oil only up 30 cents now, oil is backing off, 9,201 now, it's coming back a bit. The Dow is up 118, it's backing off a bit too. S&P up 26, NASDAQ up 135, but NASDAQ is gaining, the Dow is slipping a little, but is this just the opening little four or five minute thing and then we go from here? We're going to find out shortly everybody. 8.14, 8.15 on SoFi. Go, SoFi, go. That's what I'd like to comment on about SoFi. Thank you very much. Just go, baby, go. Run that puppy. GameStop, $17.16, the high of 17.20 here. We're pushing the high of the day around right here, right now on GameStop, up 32 cents, 17.16, 17.18 now and a 17.26 high. We've got upward movement and pressure on GameStop. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. Thank you, thank you, thank you everyone for popping in and joining in for the show. Let's see if you get richer today on option expiry day right here. 17.17 on GameStop, 8.13 on SoFi, up $1.24 on Apple, pushing 172 again right there on the Apple shares. We have 100 thumbs ups officially. The triple digits have been breached. Thank you everyone for helping out, getting us to 100 thumbs ups and counting six minutes into the show. We're running along, up 17 now on Rocket Lab, 4.51 and 35 gain on SoFi, 26 cent gain on GameStop. Matterport up 5.5, 23 and me up a penny. We've got Apple up 133, Goldman up 177, Cisco up 26, Tesla up 489, ARK Innovations up a buck, Microsoft up 327, Pfizer up 54 cents. We're up nicely, 1.7%. HBQ up 35 cents, Google up 28, Amazon up $2, NVIDIA up eight bucks, eight and a quarter. Unity up 93, AI up 78 to 25.95, up 33%. Adobe up $3, Netflix up 4.30 right here. We've got a definite upward movement going on in the market right now. Okie dokie. Welcome to the party, pals. Nice to have you here. 8.14 on SoFi. Looks like the high of the day has been 8.15. We are at the high of the day on SoFi at 37 cents, 4.7% on SoFi. I don't see any news. Do you know of any news? I don't see any, but it's moving up. Interesting. Okay. Go SoFi go. Just go. Don't ask questions. Go higher. Thank you very much. Good enough with me. 125 gain on the Dow. 17.17 now on GameStop up 33. Okay. Breaking news stories. US stocks open higher after inflation data, but the S&P 500 is heading for September loss. Stocks open higher after inflation data, but head for monthly and quarterly losses. There you go. Like I said, oversold. That's what I'm thinking. 158 though on the Dow. We're popping up again. We're improving on the Dow now. GameStop 17.03, SoFi 8.15. So we're jumping around here now. That's what we kind of figured would be happening. Marcus number 103. Matthew, what are your thoughts on if government shuts down? Do you think the market will go down if the government shuts down? This is kind of like the impeachment crap that now Americans have to go through all the time. You've got an opposition party, the Republicans, who are admittedly kind of dysfunctional right now. They're in the middle of a real turmoil here. They can't get their act together in Congress. They've got the majority by six or seven seats, and they're a mess. And they've got infighting going on. I think the American public is sick and tired of the dysfunction, but honestly, I think if you ask most Americans, they don't give a crap. They don't care. Back in the Clinton days, and this is going back to the 1990s, back in the Clinton days when government shutdowns were being done, that was a big deal. No one could believe that this was going to happen. And Clinton did the right thing. He basically just blamed the Republicans for it and wouldn't cave on their demands. He just wouldn't do it. And they eventually had to give up because they were losing support in the polls because they were coming off looking like idiots. And for a long time, the Bob Doles of this world, and I try to remember the other characters that were running the Republicans at that time, they won nothing. The other amazing thing was,\n",
      "And this is what no one talks about today, especially Republicans. During the Clinton presidency for about six of the eight years that he was president, the United States had surpluses. The United States government was bringing in more money than it was spending, and the Republicans wanted to shut down government. They wanted him to cut taxes, and he wouldn't do it. He said, we can't cut taxes, we gotta have a surplus. We can't have a deficit. Of course, after Clinton was done with his two terms, Al Gore won the presidential election by having the most popular votes, but George Bush was given the presidency by the Supreme Court of the United States because they gave him Florida. What's the first thing that President Bush did within months of taking over? He cut taxes. And within months, the US economy went right back into deficit spending, which is everything the Republicans were against for generations. But Bush and his pals cut taxes because he got backed by corporate America big time, and they wanted a payoff, and they got it. The top-end 1%ers got the payoff they wanted from George Bush. And for five years, the US Treasury did not issue 30-year bonds. Why didn't the US Treasury issue 30-year bonds? They didn't need the money. The American government didn't need to borrow money for 30 years. They had more money coming in than they were spending. They were buying off, they were paying off bonds. 30-year notes were maturing. They would just pay for them, buy them, and not issue replacement bonds. And so the United States government's balance of deficit was shrinking during Clinton's presidency while Republicans were shutting down the government, which caused a huge kerfuffle in the markets. Oh, the markets reacted terribly to that. Today, we don't give a crap is the answer from most Americans. They don't give a crap. They don't pay attention to it. They know it's a government stunt by a bunch of clowns in Congress that have gone down the road that everyone predicted they would do when they became the majority party of the Congress. Number one, no new bills. Number two, investigate Hunter Biden. Number three, investigate the president. Number four, just now shut down the government and do an impeachment inquiry all at the same time. The clown show is exactly what all voters were expecting would happen if the Republicans got control of the House. And they did. And so you had the Senate, which is Democrat, the Republican, which is the Democrat, the White House, Democrat, and you got the House, which is Republican. Nothing is getting done. No surprise. The market doesn't give a crap. It's up 100. The Dow's up 120 points. It doesn't care. How about that? BWOI on open interest on AI, $25 put sits at 5,000 plus. So watch for that drop by the end of the day possible. They can get it down there. They would also wipe out over 5,000 open interest on the call side, maximum paying $25. JR, unfortunately, poll data is no longer reliable. So it gives voters permissions to play chicken with the American economy. JR, that's the problem with cutting taxes. It goes to the top and the average Joe sees very little tax revenue. Exactly, if you're an American working away and you make 45,000 a year and your wife makes 45,000, you have a household of 100,000 a year and you're being given a $20 a month tax break. Are you going to buy a brand new car now? You got $20 a month less than taxes. You going on a holiday to Hawaii? You got to buy yourself a new patio set for $1,500 at Costco because you're paying 20 bucks a month less than taxes? I don't think so. No, tax cuts are not the stimulator. If you earn 10 million a year and you don't have to pay half a million in tax because of a tax cut, it's great for you. But are you going to buy an extra loaf of bread now? No, you're going to eat just as much as you ate last week. Are you going to buy a patio set? No, you already have a patio set. You're making 10 million a year. What's the change to you? Oh, you're going to add 500,000 a year to your savings. That's the difference. Are you going to create jobs because of this? I don't think so. You're not going to spend a half a million or more, a million a year, half a million a year more into the economy. You're not going to do it. For what? Another Mercedes? I already have four Mercedes. Another Tesla? No. There you go. I don't know. Required viewing, JJ, the deficit myth, the biggest lie in politics. JR, no take. My 20 month and do something better with it. That's why I paid taxes in the first place. JR, trickle down didn't work. Reagan proved that. Yes, that's only 50 years ago that we knew that didn't work. 40, 50 years ago, the trickle down didn't work, never worked, never will. No, no, no. The Dow's up 96. It's coming back, isn't it? How much lower will the Dow go? Will it reach a point and then shoot up again? Or are we just, we got the rain, we got the bump, and now we're going to give it all back? Is that what's going to happen? It's option expiry day. There's a lot of volatility out here. We have SoFi at 8.25. That is the high of the day. Up 48 cents on your SoFi. 6% gain today on your SoFi. No matter what the president is saying, or the Congress is saying, or Senate is doing, or anything else is having a bad effect on SoFi, SoFi is up 48 cents to 8.25. GameStop, 17.09, high of the day, 17.26. Up 25 cents right now, holding its own. That's what we got. The Dow's up 92, S&P up 25. The NASDAQ is the winner, up 1.09%, up 144 points. Not giving it up, so it's the NASDAQ, baby, not the Dow that's leading the way. The Dow is only one quarter of what the NASDAQ is doing. The Dow should be up 400 points to match NASDAQ. Right now, it's only up 90 points. So there is definitely a lag going on here on the Dow. Adobe is up six bucks. Spyder's up 216, Triple Q's are up 361. GameStop is at 17.13. SoFi, 8.26, up 49, another penny higher. Apple up 132, Netflix up five bucks. AI up 87 cents to 26.03. NVIDIA up $9. Tesla up 4.80. Rocket Lab up 17 cents. Matterport up five and a half. SmartRent up a penny. ATIP up a dime. Unity up 93. Google up a dollar. Moderna up 240. Cisco up nine. Pfizer up 54. IBM still down 47 cents today. HBQ up 35. Microsoft up 5.30. Amazon up 277. Home Depot down 32 cents. Bannick up 241. Goldman up 149. Boeing is up 135. Facebook Meta up 565. Target up 88. JP Morgan up nine. Costco down 272. Walmart down 111. Disney up 51 cents. American Airlines unchanged. DraftKings up 75 cents a share. AMC up 28 to 807. Royal Caribbean up 42 cents. Carnival up seven cents at 14.50 and only up seven. Norwegian down 24 cents a share. There you go. 92 point gain on the Dow versus, I show 70 on one device, 90 on another with GameStop at 17.18. And SoFi, 8.30. New high again on your SoFi. 8.30 a share on SoFi. The volume 4.9 million in 19 minutes on SoFi. GameStop volume 409,000. Not as much as yesterday, but better than normal at 17.16. 8.29 on SoFi with a high of 8.30. Interesting developments. Now, is it because student loans start Monday? Is that it? I don't know. I don't know. Something is kicking SoFi higher today by 51 cents a share. There is definitely buying coming in. Six and a half percent gain easily right now. Okay. Okay. Don't know what to make of it. I'm just trying to cover it, follow it, understand it, work it, and we'll see what gives. Charlie, Uncle Bruce, thank you for speaking with Noto about SoFi. It's improved my share price and it's improved my puts. BZ, thumbs, I have no clue, but I did it. Charlie, when SoFi moves, it doesn't mess around. BZ, let's go SoFi. JR, look at that, the whipsaw on AI. Time to do rollovers. There you go. Giddy on up, kids. I like seeing you folks get richer. It's simple, it's what we want here.\n",
      "Let's hope that the good times keep coming. 26.10 on AI, up 90, 26.15, up 99 on AI. AI almost up a buck here, it's rolling. Very good, NVIDIA's up $10 a share today. NVIDIA up 10, Tesla up 6.20. Got a market going on here, a good one for, and NASDAQ and growth stocks looking okay. So far, yeah, 8.30 for the high. Thank you very much. 8.30 for the high, 8.28 right now. So far looking just great. Thank you very much and keep it coming. The Dow's up just 55, but NASDAQ up 150, which is 1.16. That is eight times better than the Dow now. The Dow is really lagging behind the NASDAQ market. S&P up 0.55, a percentage point, triple the Dow, easily triple the Dow here. The Dow should be at 165 to match S&P. So interesting what's going on over there on the Dow. Who's losing on the Dow? The losers, Travelers, UnitedHealth, Walmart, Merck, Chevron, Johnson & Johnson, McDonald's, Procter & Gamble, Honeywell, Amgen, IBM down 13 cents, Caterpillar, JP Morgan. Winners on the Dow, not enough of them, but Nike is up 8.2%, 7.40 a share on Nike. Walgreens is up, Salesforce, Intel, Microsoft, Dow Chemical. Apple up almost a percentage point to 172.20. Boeing, Walt Disney, 3M, American Express, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Coca-Cola is higher, Home Depot, Visa, Cisco. Those are the winners. The rest are losers, and this Dow is up 62 points. That's what I'm showing, kids. What can I say? You know? That's the dealio right there. So far right now, 8.26, 8.28, with a high of 8.30 on the session today. At the moment, that's what we've got right there, everybody. Thank you for joining us. Nice to have you with us. Up day so far, kind of. Dow up 71, Adobe up 650. Very good day. SoFi,\n",

Did you buy some souvenirs to hand out in Sacacas? Beach Boy. Uncle Bruce, do you know ENPH? I recognize the symbol, but I don't think I recognize it enough. ENPH. Why is that? What is it about this one? N phase energy. Nope, nope, I don't. 122.22 up 220 a share. N phase is a global energy technology company which engages in the design, development, manufacture, and sale of microinverter systems for the solar photovoltaic industry. Voltaic. The firm's products include IQ7 microinverter series, IQ battery, IQ envoy, IQ microinverter. And all of this means nothing to me. I mean, I kind of know what you're talking about, but I don't know anything about these guys. Headquartered in Fremont, California. Yeah, no, don't know. The year range, 116 for the low, which is kind of where it is, 340 for the high, yikes. So this has come off a lot. PE multiple 31 times earnings. It's been whacked.

I don't know how long they're good for. I, you know, you decide. Beach Boy, if Alberto won't show up, it means the FBI will confiscate all the pies. Not legal without Alberto. So be careful.

      "California Governor Gavin Newsom said earlier this month that if Feinstein's seat were to be vacated, he would appoint an African American woman to the position on an interim basis, but that he would not appoint one of the Democrats already running to fill the seat after the 2024 election. Leading candidates in that race include Democratic California Reps Barbara Lee, Katie Porter, and Adam Schiff. California was known for her advocacy on causes to liberals and Californians, including the environment, abortion access, and gun control. The Democrat was one of the wealthiest members of Congress, according to the New York Times, was raised in affluence. She was already well-moneyed when she married the late Richard Bloom, a wealthy financier in 1980. Her combined net worth, their combined net worth in 2021 is estimated at more than $96 million at the time. Well, now it's time for Mr. Newsom, Governor Newsom, to figure out his replacement for that state. Time will tell. There we go, there we go, okay everybody. JR, it was my first experience with a Tesla, with a Tesla gave me a surprise. There is little need to brake. Take your foot off the gas and it slows down all by itself. Dang near bashed my head on the windshield. Yes, when I hit the brakes, yeah, I know what you mean. That regenerative braking is incredible. I love driving the Tesla last year and the year before down to California. Manager, lock in any gains if you have, or be a bag holder. Constantine, Uncle Bruce, I wanted to mention, I have AI, $25 deep in the money as I was able to write on it, even when it fell below $25. Matthew, I think the gains continue into next week. BW, I didn't know that Adam Schiff was a black woman. The way the article read, he's one of the three running for the seat, so he won't be nominated for it. Anyway, the Dow up 79, Adobe up 13.50. It's climbing, it's still climbing all by itself. Adobe doesn't care what the rest of the market is doing. GameStop is back to $17 now, up 16 cents. GameStop has recovered back to 17. SoFi, $18.12 up, or $8.12 on SoFi, up 36 cents, $1.93 gain on Apple right now. Here you go, some quick updates for you there. The US market, the Dow was up 62, S&P up 25, Nasdaq ahead by 156, oil down 54 cents, continuing to slip further, 91.17. It has been a swoon from $93 this morning to 91.17, almost a full $2 loss intraday in three hours. Something's up, something, or something's down, but something's going on. I don't know what it is, but something's going on over there. All right, there you have it. Come on, Bruce. You had to laugh on that one. Matthew, Biden's quest to cancel student debt continues. He has a new plan. Headline just came out. JR, my sister-in-law graciously offered to let me use her Tesla to go to the M&G when I stayed at their house in New Jersey. I want to put that car through its paces. The computer display is amazing. The acceleration can give a person whiplash. They're incredible cars. They're absolutely amazing vehicles. I'm just so impressed with Teslas. The fact that Jennifer and I would only plug it in into the 110 outlet in our garage, in the condo we were renting. We'd just plug it into the garage. Five and a half miles for every hour it was plugged in would be the range that would add. Heck, in a thorny afternoon, we would leave it plugged in until noon the next day for a spin. 20 hours later, we just added 115 miles of range to the car. We had 120 miles when we plugged it in. Where are we going for an hour? 235 miles somewhere? No. We'd go to Costco, go to Safeway, go to Walmart, put on 15 miles and come back, plug it in. Fabulous. That was just that. If I owned one full-time, I would have a 240 plug installed in the garage. You would add 35 to 40 miles of range per hour that you're plugging in. In certain states in the US, you can program the Tesla to only charge when the cost per kilowatt is at its lowest of the day. Certain communities in the United States have variable rates for electricity. In the middle of the night, you've got your lowest cost per megawatt or whatever it's called, kilobyte, whatever you call it. You tell the Tesla, yeah, between 1 in the morning and 5 in the morning, charge it up. You plugged it in, but it won't take the charge until the cost of electricity hits a certain level, then it kicks in automatically. As soon as it tops up to the level you want, it shuts off. Smart. Really, really ingenious. I just love it. If anyone thinks that e-cars are so unreliable, just look at Tesla. It'll even map out where to stop and get a charge on the long trip. No need to fret, exactly. It will say on the computer how much charge you're going to have left by the time you get to that charger or the next charger or the next charger. It'll give you a range. You can make it to these four chargers. You choose which one you want to go to. By the way, there are openings at this one. This one has got a waiting list. There's a lineup to use it. This one's wide open. Fabulous. BW. I just filled up gas at Costco. 18 gallons of unleaded, $83. You're not going to pay that kind of money for electricity. I mean, Jen and I were charging up in Phoenix when we went to a wedding. The first year we went down there, 2021. We paid the highest rate for electricity that we were going to pay. Middle of the day at a shopping mall. Gasoline was two and a half times as expensive as electricity on a mile per gallon basis. You couldn't beat it. We were paying $12 in electricity to get $50 worth of gas equivalent. You can't compare the two. The worst case scenario, I think, was maybe half. $80 for gas. Not even $40, actually. We never paid $40 for electricity. Maybe $15 to $18 from nothing to charged up. It was so good. Bobby, I keep bawling the Kia EV6 website for e-car. There you go. I like the reliability of Tesla. I like the ingenuity of Tesla. I like the fact there's so many on the road. That servicing Teslas is getting easier and easier and easier. And will continue to be easier. They, of course, have perfected making them. They've made now 2 million vehicles. They know what they're doing making their cars. They're everywhere. Yeah, it's pretty good. Superchargers are becoming easy to find all the time. It's pretty cool. I've got a young lady calling me from Canada that I can't take the call. You're going to have to contact that certain young lady yourself. Because I'm on the air. And that certain young lady doesn't know I'm on the air. BW, the only thing they've got to work on, Bruce, I can fill up in 5 minutes and drive 400 miles. You have to sit for how long to be able to drive for hours if you did during the day. Go to a supercharger. You're charged up in 10-12 minutes. That is not an issue. If you need to go to the bathroom late, first of all, you're driving a long way. After a couple hours, you want to stop and get a pee break anyway. Maybe you'll stop and get a coffee at a Starbucks or something. You don't mind a 10-12 minute stop with a Tesla. You don't mind. We sure didn't. We didn't find it an inconvenience at all. If I'm going to drive 400 miles to get somewhere, I'm not trying to get to that destination within a 3-minute window. That's an all-day drive. That's, what, 8 hours at 50 miles an hour? Yeah, it takes me an extra 10 minutes to get there because I'm using electricity at one quarter the cost. Thank you. That's money in my pocket. I'll invest that. I'll take that inconvenience any time. Say goodbye to the gas stations.\n",
      "I love it when I'm in California and I drive by the mobile station, I drive by an Exxon station, I drive by the Costco gas bar and I see these prices for gasoline at 4.55, 5.50 a gallon in California, knowing that we're paying a buck, buck 25, buck 50 a gallon equivalent for electricity. Please, love it. That's just me though. To each his own, to each his own, her own, whatever works for you. We liked the Model 3, which is the stand, but we loved the Model Y, the hatchback, the SUV version, small three, loved it too. And loved a lot of things about the vehicle, a lot of other things. The big one, one of the big ones was how quiet it is. Jen and I can talk like this on the highway. There's no sound coming out of this car. There's wind noise at 100 and what, at 80 miles an hour, there's wind noise, but there's no engine and exhaust and transmission noises, no. Love it, really, really love it. Okay, we've been on the air an hour 51 minutes. Thank you for joining me here so far, guys. We have 130 thumbs ups, I thank you for that. We've got a 48 point gain on the Dow. The Dow has given up some ground, certainly, but the day ain't over, is it? See what's going on here. The shutdown, I don't know if there's gonna be any issues on it or not, market-wise. We'll find out Monday, really, if there's anything to this. Is it serious or not? Do we care, do we not care? We're up 47 on the Dow, 22 gain on S&P, which is a half a percentage point, much better than the 0.14 for the Dow. And the NASDAQ is up 1.08%, 142 points. Oil, negative 67 cents a barrel to 9,104. We're going under 91 on oil. It looks like, to me, we might be under 91 today, down 67 cents so far today. Adobe holding a 10.70 gain, make it 11.40. Adobe holding a nice gain, a gain stop 16.92. SoFi, 8.09. Apple at 172.43, up 174. Netflix up 196. AI, 25.65, up 49. NVIDIA up 7.78. Tesla up 7.19. Good days here, very good days. Unity up 75, Google up 128, Moderna up 154. We've got Microsoft up 450, Amazon up two bucks. Goldman up 65, Meta up 380. These are the big movers here, not bad. And those of you riding iron condors, you've got to be smiling from ear to ear on your condors. A lot of these condors you've ridden for a week or two or a month out are well within your ranges, no worries whatsoever. It's looking great. I like the way this is coming together for you. Well done, everyone out there. And BW, once again, Bruce, I'm not arguing with you on the electric vehicles, but I think we need to be hybrids until they go fully electric, just under the infrastructure, unless California, New York City. Well, it only took California five years. In the big scheme of things, I don't see every single American going EV in one year. I think it's a 10-year shift, maybe 15-year shift, and infrastructure will catch up. It will happen. There's enough money in them there, Hills. Bobby, I hope they're affordable to the masses in 2026. I'm going to start saving for one next year. Flint, have a great weekend, everybody. Thank you. Splur, just in case, I'm wishing you all a relaxed weekend out there. Thank you, Splur. Yeah, I love it. I'm a fan of the EV shift, and I'm not worried at all about the infrastructure thing. You hear all the horror stories, and you hear all these guys, well, if everybody wanted electric cars today, there would be no way we can handle it. Yeah, okay. As if everybody goes EV in five minutes. I mean, give me a break. The thing that I find funny is that I'm telling you that you can get electricity for your car from a 110 outlet for probably 90% of your driving needs for the cost of electricity from your house without installing anything, without installing anything extra. And if you need a fast charge, you drive to your local charger, supercharger, and you're paying a third of the price for gasoline. Do you see a lineup of Tesla dealers with a one third saving? No, you don't. People, when they're ready, they'll get an EV. Even if it was free, they wouldn't line up like crazy because it's an investment. A car is a big deal. It's a lot of money. So it'll happen over time. Yeah, yeah. Because 15 years ago, when Tesla came up with the Model S, people were looking at the Model S and there were the skeptics going, it'll never work. This company will be belly up before they produce their 1000th car. And then what? You've spent 100 grand on a car that you can't get parts for. Mark my words. So people were saying, well, the Model S, what parts do you need? No problems whatsoever. The performance that a Tesla offers today for what you are paying for it versus what you pay to get a Tesla at the beginning of the initial run, it's incredible. The Tesla's performances and options and features are way better than they were 10 years ago, five years ago, four years ago. And in five years from now, Tesla's coming off the line will be even smarter and even better, cheaper to operate, more reliable, better performers. The upgrades they just made to the Model 3 has improved the efficiency of the vehicle by a huge amount. Gas car companies cannot compete. Gasoline powered vehicles do not improve their performance as electric vehicle improvements have had in the last five years. Gasoline vehicles have topped out in the innovation, which is incredible. Gasoline vehicles and their innovation has been phenomenal the last 15, 20 years. Electric, just as phenomenal. And from a higher starting point, it's only gonna get better. I see a day where electric vehicles will use less energy per mile than they're using now. It'll continue to get more efficient, which means each vehicle uses less electricity to get around, multiplied by millions and millions of units. It's profound, but you gotta wanna buy into it. There are people who will never, ever believe it. And that's okay, it's the world, it's the world. It's all right, it's nothing personal. It's nothing personal. I think it would be, it would cover most people's commute every day. Just plug in your EV at home. Breach Boy, Flint, are you bringing cashmere pie for Alberto? BW, but if you're changing up your car on the 110 outlet, what's powering the lamp? There is no lamp, that's the thing. There's no lamp. Deep Value, the Model 3 upgraded version is amazing. There's no limits for Tesla. JR, I like Kia also, but Tesla has got a long history of making and selling great cars, yeah. I find the simplistic dashboards amazing. A lack of switches all over the place. Then I'll see a Mercedes electric car with switches all over the place. And I just go, how stupid is this? They got all these wires and all these contact points and all these fuses and all these lit ups. Stupid, put it on the screen, man. Just put it on the screen, the tablet. I mean, come on, you know. It's okay, it's okay. To each his own, it's fine, it's fine. Folks, thank you for joining Jennifer and I this week from Vienna. We really appreciate you being here. We're looking forward to next week and the week after, looking forward to New Jersey in three weeks, looking forward to seeing you guys. That'll be great. Have yourselves a great weekend.

Jen's gonna say, have a great time. Have a great weekend. Have a great weekend from Jen. And we'll catch up with you guys next week. Sell My House Fast, I saw a headline yesterday that car dealerships are complaining that they can't sell cars for 115 grand. They had better ramp those prices down if they wanna catch on. Aurora, have a great weekend. Uncle Bruce, thank you, Aurora. Thank you, Sell My House. JR, Deep Value. BW, Beach Boy. Thank you, Splare. Flint, Bobby. Thank you, BW. Thank you, who else? Matthew.

      "Testing, testing, testing. Is this thing on? Is there anybody out there? Hello to your buddy Uncle Bruce here. Welcome all to the live broadcast here. It's a Tuesday, October the 3rd, 2023, coming to you live from a little town known as Tel Aviv in Israel. Holy moly macaroni, the guy's putting it on the road. Welcome all to the show. Loving it here. It's a very interesting city so far. Haven't gone very far yet, but that's about to change. Jen and I arrived yesterday from Vienna, Austria, and we're glad to have made it here. I've always been curious about visiting Israel, and here we are in the Holy Land. Unbelievable. Nice to see you folks. We've got a negative opening coming up from what I can see so far. Down 138 on the Dow. 20 point negative on S&P and NASDAQ down 91 so far. That's what I see at the moment. Oil is down, looks like 39 cents this morning in Texas. 88.44 a barrel in Texas. Yesterday, the Dow lost 74 points, but it had a recovery. If you take a look here at this one day chart yesterday, that was yesterday's start. Had a bit of a run, but then had a terrible run at 1230, dropped like crazy. But then it came back, a little shot, another dip, and then a nice shot up at the end of the day there to lose only 74 points. Unfortunately, right now we're down 132 at the moment. This is the one week chart for the Dow. It's been a downhill ride most of the way. We had a little recovery last week, but then dropped. This is a one month chart for the Dow, and it was plateauing there for a week or two, and then down we went. And a three month chart, look at that. We dipped here. We had a plateau here, a dip, a plateau, and a dip. So it's down two steps, up one, down two, up one the last several months. We'll see how much longer this lasts. What is causing this to happen? I know what it is. I think you know. If you've been around here a while, you know exactly what's going on. It's all about interest rates. Yeah, inflation maybe, but interest rates. The higher the interest rates that are being offered, you go online to SoFi and take a look how much SoFi is offering you for your interest rate, for your savings account, checking account, you'll know. Compared to what SoFi was offering you a year ago, two years ago, if you were around that long, you weren't getting 4, 4.5% on your money. You are now. There are money managers out there around the world, including this town. There's a lot of bankers here. In Zurich and Milan, Italy and Frankfurt and London and Paris, Tokyo, New York, of course, Chicago. There are bankers around the world and investors around the world who are figuring out, hey man, I can get 5.2% from the US government for a two year treasury. I can buy a two year treasury with six months left to go, three months left to go, a year left to go. I mean, I don't have to buy a two year, two year out treasury. I can buy a two year treasury that expires in three weeks. But the annual rate of interest on a two year right now is like 5.1, 5.2%. You've got a couple of billion lying around in between deals. You're going to put your billions to work inside US two year treasuries because the liquidity is there to, you can easily buy them, easily sell them. On top of the fact that you're getting your 5 point whatever percent interest on that money, if you're from Europe, the\n",

      "UK, you're from Israel, you're from Canada, you're from Japan, you're from Fiji, you're from Australia. I don't care where you're from. The US dollar is rising against all currencies. So not only are you getting the effective rate of 5.2% on your money, you're also making money on your money because against your home currency, if it isn't the US dollar, you're getting richer on your appreciating US dollar against the currency you have. That's something to think about. Of course, if you're a shareholder, if you're just one of those viewers of Stock Markets with Bruce, and you figured out in the last two years, it occurred to you in the last two, two and a half years that rather than be a dumb money person, which you may have been at one time, and the media called you dumb money. Remember that when you were called dumb money? You turned around and said, I'm not dumb money. You know what I'm doing? I'm going to write options against my GameStop shares. I'm going to write options against stock I already own. I'm going to bring income in just like these sophisticated hedge funds. But I'm going to do it in my style at my pace out of my house, using this little device right here. At a minimum, this is all I need. Those of you out there around the world who are watching this retired bald, hairless guy traveling from time to time, you're following what I'm telling you to do. You're bringing in capital from your shares, or from your deep in the money options, or doing iron condors cash secured puts. You're bringing income in. What income are you bringing in? US dollars. You're bringing in American money from the premiums you're getting on your options. Congratulations you are smart. You're not only bringing in income on your cash and your investments, you're bringing in US dollars into your greedy little hands where they belong. And you're doing what all the institutional traders out there are doing. All the bankers, all the insurance companies, all the pension funds, all the other entities, mutual funds that are doing. They're bringing in American money into their hot little hands for their funds That's betterment while you're doing it for your own personal account. And I say congratulations everybody because that's what it's all about man, making money in this market. You got to be ahead of 50% of everybody else. You got to be in the top half. If you can be in the top half of investors, you'll make money. You're in the bottom half making stupid investments, dumb long shot bets, just being an option buyer and not being a writer. You're doing that so you deserve to lose money. You deserve to have your butt handed to you because the pros out there are going to take it from you. Gleefully taking it from you. Many of you have not played that game and you've not fallen for that trap. You've decided, no, no Bruce. I'm going to hang out with you and Auntie Chen and the viewers of your channel. I'm going to hang out with you guys. I'm going to learn how to write options and I'm going to bring money into my account every week, every couple of weeks, every month or so, whatever the timing is. And I'm going to say thank you very much. May I have another because boy, these option buyers, they're nuts. I mean the amount of money they hand me for what I'm writing to these guys, it's ridiculous. It's just insane. Yeah, you're going to take it. And because of you guys, as a collective audience of mine, Jen and I want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts for being viewers of this channel and being supporters of this YouTuber's channel.

Love it. Chase Rosita Parker. Thank you for being here. And the thumbs up meter. Thank you, everybody. Let's see. Good afternoon. Global's GameStop hit 52 week low. I bought back all my covered calls for 45 percent profits. Would you sell cash secured puts or just buy the stock at this price? That's a good question. I mean, if you buy more stock and you can write more options, you know, what's wrong with that? You write 18, 17 and a half, 18, 19, 20s if you can. Take in more cash, whatever they want to give you. Welcome Auntie Jen and Uncle Bruce. Thank you, Beach Boy. We're looking forward to seeing him. We're going to get together with him tonight. Karim is here. Comical name. Beach Boy tour guide for the win. That's right. MK. Good morning, afternoon, everybody. Dean. Good morning, everybody. No sell, no sell. So now Bruce is going to tell you to buy Rabila. I have no idea what that is. T-bill. Flint Creek. Oh, my gosh. That's super cool. Beach Boy. We want to see you. Matthew. Good morning. Number 34. Thumbs up. I've been seeing a lot of phantom trades. These are trades that will register on the chart. But when you refresh the chart, they disappear. I can't answer that. I don't know how that works. Matthew in SPY. He says MG. Anyone writing covered calls on GameStop? I think so. Sean. Steven Jackson. I need to MG. Steven Jackson missed out on this recent dip. I thought it would pop, but I was wrong. I forgot that message will be always right. Not a lurker. Number 42. Hello, Uncle Bruce. In Tel Aviv. Manager number 47. Not a lurker. Yes, Beach Boy tour guide. Not a lurker. Good morning, manager. Manager, Uncle Bruce, will you meet Beach Boy? Oh, yes, definitely. Alex, number 48. Good morning, everybody. Bob Cobb. A wife is wondering if Bruce has a filter on. He must be looking good today. I won't even get compliments. I don't even get compliments like that. I'm sorry, Bob. I don't know what it is. In real life, it's a sad story. But what can I say? I do what I can with what I got. I don't know. It is what it is. Thank you to several of you out there who were kind enough to keep the secret. A few folks on this channel were well aware that Auntie Jen and I were coming here to Tel Aviv. And they promised not to slip up and let Beach Boy in on it. We wanted it to be a surprise. And it worked. He had no clue. So we're really pleased about that. And I appreciate you all. Give me a thumbs up if you receive my email, says manager. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. Thank you all of you for thumbs ups that are coming in here on this show already. We have 55 and counting. Thank you all for your thumbs up so far. It is very much appreciated. Live from Tel Aviv, Israel. And Jen and I are looking forward to getting out with Beach Boy and checking out the place. And it should be fun. Yes, indeed. All good stuff. The markets, I have no idea how much fun we're going to have today. We'll have to see just what they're really thinking about here. Are these markets going to be in a foul mood all morning? Or are we just going to get a little dip and then a recovery? We did have a slight 70-odd point loss yesterday. We'll see how that works. Down 127 right now on the Dow. 21-point loss on S&P, NASDAQ down 94. The shenanigans continue in Washington. The government shutdown was not, didn't come through a Sunday late. It was averted. Now, of course, the radical right wingers of the Republican Party that desperately wanted a shutdown didn't get the shutdown. Now they're going after the speaker. We'll see how all that plays out. The Clown Show continues. All kinds of clips on YouTube about these impeachment, hearing things, a discovery to whether there should be an impeachment or not. They're coming out and it's just mind-blowing what's going on over there. I don't know. There's wacky stuff going on. I don't know. John Malone, number 53. Thank you, my friend. Alex, I managed to keep my mouth shut. Nice job, buddy. Probably going to be a red day today. Valerie is here. Good morning, everybody. And Lorraine is in the house. Good morning. I'm number 52 on the thumbs up meter. Good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us today. The strike, the auto strike continues on. More plants have been picketed. The question is, when will it get to the point where it's a full-blown walkout? I am expecting that. I'm actually expecting a full-blown, all three companies at the same time, shutting down completely because the union has got to take control of the discussions. If they want to get what they're after, if they want to get their dough, they're going to have to make a move. Their dough, they're going to have to make a move. I did see something I found interesting. I found something interesting on, again, it was a clip. Might've been on Wall Street Journal. It had to do with an auto worker who was on the picket line. And he was walking along and somebody was driving by. I guess they must've had a red light or something. And the person shouted out of the window, don't you know that by going on strike, you're going to make the cost of cars go up and we're already struggling to afford a new car. And the union worker was very, very mature about it. He was well-spoken. He said, you know, I've thought about that. He said, but I got to tell you folks, you want to walk a mile in my shoes. I work in a factory floor in a hundred degree heat. And all I have is a fan blowing hot air at me to cool me off. I don't have an air conditioned workplace. I'm working pretty hard and I'm pretty darn tired at the end of my shift. All around me are people that are 35 and younger. We can't take this kind of work being older than that. It's just too stressful, too difficult. You know, the chairman of the company, our top president gets USD$29M a year. There are others up there, many that make well over USD$1M, USD$2M a year. And I kind of go, you know, for what I get paid, for how hard I work and what I'm asking for is to keep up with inflation over the last two years and going forward. I don't think I'm being all that unreasonable. And I had to give this guy kudos. He was, he made a very good point because it's a very difficult job. It's hard physical labor. You can only do it for a certain number of years before your body gives out. And you got to be, you only go around once. He's not going to be 28, 32, 36 years old a second time. This is it. If this job finishes by the age 35, 40, he's done. He then has to find work for the next 15, 20 years to make it to retirement. What can he do depending on how beat up he is and what kind of lifetime afflictions will he have down the road? Is he going to have lower back issues, knee pain, shoulder issues? I know it's not easy stuff. In any event, does he deserve a million a year? No. But concessions were made by union workers the last 15 years and corporations have done well by it. It's kind of payback time. I'm sorry to say it's kind of payback time. The good news for the rest of you out there, for those of you who have friends of yours, relatives, associates, or yourselves, if you're working for any employer, these unionized workers get themselves a pretty reasonable deal that puts you in a stronger position, believe it or not, to possibly get a better deal yourself. These guys were to settle for 3% and 4% raises. You haven't got a hope in hell of getting a 3%, 4% raise anywhere. These folks do get 8% to 10%, 11% for the first year, two or three, adding up to 35% over the lifetime of the contract. You have a shot at getting 5%, 7%, or 8% raises in the next year or two, which will only keep you up with inflation. It's not going to make you richer. It's just going to keep you even to what your buying power is now or what it was, but you have a better shot at it. What can I say? The airline pilots, they got their massive pay increases. UPS workers got their massive pay increases. The writers and the actors in Hollywood are going for a better pay. Again, it's not the superstar actors you have to worry about. It's all the other tens of thousands of actors you don't know who are trying to make a living, and the writers, the average guys. What can I say? It's payback time for workers, and that's the bottom line.\n",
      "Humble opinion Luca number 29 a ciao everybody. How is Tel Aviv treating you guys? We came in yesterday From the airport. I had done some homework prior to coming here Where I realized that we could take a train from the airport To the facility where this hotel is located It's right part of a big shopping mall and other high-rise structures There's a train stop literally across the street from this place and I realized that we could get on this train There's an elevator to take you right down there an elevator to get you up for three American dollars You can go from the airport Right to across the street from this hotel, and I had been told that if you take a cab You got to be careful because there are certain individuals that are inside the terminal trying to talk you up get you into a cab and then there's the official cab stand where you should really go and There were horror stories out there that there are folks who get taken for a pretty expensive cab ride when it shouldn't be Ridiculously expensive. Anyway, I think we saved I think we saved about 40 bucks We took the train yesterday. We met a family on the train that Everyone here, by the way speaks English, by the way And they said oh, yeah, you want to take the train just two stops. It's all you got to do It's the best value in the whole city And you just walk across the street and that's what we did even with Jen Jen's knee is acting up, but we we toughed it out got through here. Oh Oh Yeah, we met a couple on the train who were on a three-week holiday to America and They flew in today or yesterday from Los Angeles. I said, how long was the flight from Los Angeles? To Tel Aviv 13 hours. So we just done a three-hour flight from Vienna They were really tired because of course at the time change it was just beating them up They had 13 hours of travel time plus nine hours of time differential time plus wait time So they were there they were whacked out They were just out of whack out of sorts, but they were much younger than we were. They were very happy They had a wonderful time in America. They loved it very much. They did New York California Las Vegas, they got a little bit of everything a little this little that how much can you do in three weeks in America? There's so much to see they had a great time and they were happy to be back But they were very tired, but they were very gracious Helping us. They noticed these two elderly people from Canada They were very kind to us so Tel Aviv has been great We came across the street here came into the hotel and the young man in the lobby Talking to him. Oh Asking what are you doing in Tel Aviv? So I'm a YouTube channel. You got a YouTube channel Actually, I got two YouTube channels traveling with Bruce and stock markets at first and the fellow said Oh, I'm gonna put you in a corner room I'm gonna get you a corner room instead of a regular room this way you can get way more footage for your channel Thank you very much. It pays to be a youtuber sometimes and Up we came and we went last night to the shopping mall for we thought we'd get a bite to eat We didn't know what we wanted. So I thought well, there's probably a food court down there. Let's see what happens Oh sure enough. There's a food court. All right, but oh it was mayhem. There's some kind of a holiday this week The school kids are all off this week and they were in the mall yesterday they were in the mall, but it was kind of neat to see and hear all the languages and Excitement and their exuberance and of course all the signage in English and the Hebrew and whatnot We went into a pharmacy and we we wanted to get some eye drops That we normally buy at Costco But here you got to go to a pharmacy and talk to the pharmacist. You can't just buy this stuff off the shelf like at Costco and Costco, of course you buy three bottles and get two for free, you know the special no not here You get one bottle at a time Because after all it is quasi medicine medicinal But whatever no problems all worked out We met a fellow who works in the optical department in this place from the UK I said, do you speak English? Oh, we're certain. Well, certainly sir. I do He says we're talking from he says you're not from America. You're from Canada, aren't you? I said, yes, I am I am from Canada. I can tell you talk A lovely chat with that fellow. So we have a we've had a pleasant experience so far, although it's been limited We've only now been here about 24 hours. So Once we get up with Beach Boy, we'll we'll get out and see what's going on. Thank you all What else is going on? Thank you a pharma. So whatever you do there don't start any kind of a religious incident Trust me, we'll be fine. I will behave ourselves Maria good 65 and good morning, everybody Thank you for these thumbs ups Maria J boy morning all time to lurk Dude, uncle Bruce gets to start treatment. That's right the feds Have you in a relocated any Palestinians yet Bobby I was are you sticking around for the weekend protest? No, we're out of here Friday the feds man Jr. A number 62. Good morning, everybody. No, we're out of here Friday morning back to Europe. We'll be in Zurich on Friday and We'll conclude our European portion of the show. They're good a JM lamp There are no lamps in Israel, there are no lamps in Tel Aviv Nothing like that whatsoever. Who cares says number 72. Let's go, baby Thank you, my friend for the thumbs ups. Appreciate it. We have a 74 now Showing this morning. Welcome one and all 53 minutes to go before we start our show Start trading on the day and we'll see what happens with that. We're showing pre-market right now In the in the futures down 155 for the Dow 26 point dip on S&P 114 on Nasdaq Nasdaq is down three quarters of a percentage point S&P two-thirds of a percent Dow half a point and Crude oil has inched its way back. It's up one penny right now one penny 8883 trying to trying to improve at this point. That's what's going on at the moment On our our pre-market right now. All right, everybody. Thank you. Waverly. I'm number 74 on that thumbs up meter Charlie I'm Bruce Can you can you offer any suggestions on what covered calls to write and what time frame for? Game stop a little nervous about writing at these low levels Well again, remember no matter what you write on GameStop if there's a surge in the stock you do a rollover So you never you never have to worry about being walked in you might end up going out in time a little bit But not to worry Game stop what to do at the moment on GME. That is the proverbial question. I know a number of you out there are You know either Reluctant to write or you're curious So you've got options out now and they're coming down in price should you buy them back and should you roll? That is the question now the stock this morning in the pre-market is 15 20 off 19 cents We had that dip yesterday during the session a dollar what a dollar seven lower So, what do you do? Do you write something? Near term or what? Can you what kind of money? Can you bring in if you're gonna write October 20 calls? You're not gonna bring in a whole lot of dough because we're talking 17 days from now There won't be that much in the way of premiums 60 cent a 16 dollar contracts will bring you about 60 Cents or so according to last night's close So, you know, you can pull in a quick 60 odd cents, but these are 16 dollar calls 17 is only bringing about 38 to 40 cents So nothing much for November for October to get you excited about if you're looking for a November, right? You look out to the third Friday of November. That would be November 17 You want to write? 16 dollar calls you'll being you'll bring in about a dollar 10 17 is about 80 85 cents 18 62 66 cents something like that You want a little more money? You're gonna have to go further out. So December 15th looks like That's the third Friday in December 16 25 165 range 17 50 is a dollar 25 range 20s will only bring you 77 84 cents January 2024. So that's So like November December January three and a half months You want to write 20s? 105 110 1875 so dollar 30 35 17 50s 150 160 65 something like that now if you write January's January 20 24 You write these 175s for a buck 30 35 You have to look at it this way If the stock stays under that level for the most part For the next month or two say into late this month into the middle of November late November They these will depreciate to 80 cents Maybe a little less You're not gonna get rich writing these but you're not gonna get poor either you'll\n",
      "have a little extra cash come in with a protection up to $18.75. The shares go to $17.50 into December and these contracts will still only be worth about a buck. So you'll make money on your stock as it recovers, or you're deep in the money calls, and or these calls will drop in value as the time shrinks out on them. That's to be considered. If the shares, however, want to take a run to $20, thank you very much. The earnings are coming between now and January. There'll be earnings coming up. But if they do want to pop to $18 to $20, yeah, these calls will be two, two and a half, three bucks, depending on how much in the money they are. But so what? You'll buy those back and you'll write contracts further out. You'll go further out to June or April of next year. You'll go from $18.75 to $20, or you'll go to $22.50 for June, take in two or three bucks and say, come and get me up here. If that's the way it wants to go. If you're writing today to bring in income, bring in some cash, you're going to buy some cheap stock here, or you're going to buy some deep in the money calls, maybe tens at an even lower price and write some more, more power to you. Bring your average cost on your tens even lower, bring in additional income. Look, if you're bringing in $1.50 to $2 on a $6 call, that's a 30% return on any money you're putting into these deep in the money calls. It's totally up to you how you want to handle it. But that would be, those are just some general thoughts. It's kind of, you know, you got to really decide which way you want to go. You don't have to lock yourself out till next summer or anything like that. I wouldn't worry about that. All right. Looks like Tesla's going down against his manager, Hector. Charlie, thanks. Also, my question, Charlie saying it takes a lot of time to generate any real profits. Well, with GameStop being a $15 stock right now, you're not going to get $5 premiums on a $15 stock. You'll get $5 premiums on a $40 stock, but not a $15 stock. To get a $2 premium, $1.50 on a $15 stock. That's percentage wise significant, but the stock is down. We do know that the end of the latest quarter has just happened, I think, for GameStop. If I'm not mistaken, I believe we have just entered the end of an earnings period. Just give me a second here. Financials. There we go. Can I get those to pop up or not? Let me see my biggest iPad is a very finicky right here. Quarterly financials. The last quarterly financials that were issued by GameStop were July 31. So August, September, October. The end of this month is the next quarter. So they're into the latest quarter here. The last three quarters, the company is essentially broken even. It had a gain, a loss, and more or less a break even. And the company is hauling in now more money and interest income than ever before. They're hauling in probably $50M, $60M a year. And that will add up again in this coming quarter. $15M will be income from just the money on hand. They make $5M or $10M this quarter from their operations, plus $15M interest income. They could have a $20M profit for this quarter, which means for the last four quarters combined, a $10M, $15M profit for the company. Now, the next quarter will be November, December, January. That's the big one. That's the big quarter. And in February, March, we'll find out how those numbers work out. If they have a quarter like last year, surprise earnings. Last year, they made $50M in that particular quarter. If this year, with the interest income and lower expenses that they've done, they pull off a $100M, $150M quarter profit in that quarter, we might be $20M to $25M to $30M a share with those kinds of results. You've got to decide for yourself though, what's your tolerance level? How patient are you? Will you write something for December, January now? And knowing that by then it'll be March for that big quarter, how do you want to play it out? You've got a lot to think about here. We'll see what gives. All right. Charlie, thank you. Uncle B, I think next earnings is December. There you go. There you go. It's a lot of food for thought. No question about it. 24 minutes to go. And I believe we begin trading today. That is the story. I'm sticking to it. I see us sitting here with futures down $165 on the Dow, $28 on S&P, $125 on Nasdaq. OK, there it is. Dang, the strobe light filter is making my head spin. I'm not sure what exactly you're referring to. But it's sunny today in Tel Aviv because the sun is coming in on me. And I'm using it as lighting. I've got a white little curtain in front here just to take off most of the glare. Hopefully it won't drive you guys nuts. Thank you for 81 thumbs ups now. Appreciate that. Under 41 of you here. We're live from Tel Aviv in Israel today on Stock Markets with Bruce. My latest GameStop right is down to $0.16. My BB is set at $0.09. You're going to buy him back at $0.09. I got you, buddy. Right on. Lame Duck. What light are you talking about? There's no lights in Tel Aviv. There are no lamps. There's nothing like that. Bobby, what sun? There is no sun. What are you talking about? There's no sunshine. I don't know what you mean. Gotcha. All right. Thank you, everybody. Fun times at the OK Corral. Cheers, everybody. I actually found literally across the alleyway, across the street from the lobby of this hotel connected to one of these buildings is a grocery store. I mean a legit grocery store. This is Coke Zero caffeine free. The first one I've seen since Liverpool or London or Dortmund. I can't remember the last time I saw caffeine free Coke Zero. Wow. Oh my gosh. It's kind of fun. There you go. Karen. Uncle Bruce, I bought a deep in the money call for AI for a $20 strike, which is getting closer to at the money. These are Jan 2025s. What to do? Just write on it. Just write a contract on it. Don't worry about it. Just go ahead. Write a call on it. Don't worry about it. You don't have to do anything. Manager, JR plan today is going long on Tesla. I will be selling cash secured put. Dude. Oh yeah. I see what JR means. The key is to just listen to Uncle Bruce. Then you can imagine he's a puppy dog. There you go. Matthew, there's shenanigans going on in SPY. I'm still holding my iron condor, Uncle Bruce, but there are shenanigans going on on SPY. I don't know if that's real or memorics. I'm showing them down $2.32 right now. The Dow is off. S&P is off. NASDAQ is off. This would make sense. This would make sense to have it off. Taking a peek here at the markets. Let me flash up there right now. With 21 minutes to go, the S&P is down 30 points. So $1.50 lower for the SPYders would be expected. So this is a little lower than maybe it should be, but I wouldn't flinch at all. Constantine, good morning. Uncle Bruce, thank you for showing a piece of Tel Aviv over there. I am thumbs up number 83. Let's have a great day. You got it, buddy. Splatter, damn, it's time. It's time to get out of bed and join the darkness party without sun. I don't know what that means. 84 thumbs up. Thanks, everybody, for that. Keep on coming in. Welcome everyone to the show. We are live from Tel Aviv, Israel today. Jen and I flew in yesterday. Top secret security everywhere, bodyguards so as to not be discovered. We didn't want anyone to find out that we were getting in here. Very few people knew that we were coming here, but we made it. We have snuck in and we're in Tel Aviv, Israel, and we're having a wonderful time. Looking forward to visiting a very special person today, quite looking forward to that. Welcome all to the channel, the show from Tel Aviv. Oh my gosh, thank you. YouTube is all I have to say. Thank you to the YouTube community. It's the only reason we're here. It's the only way we got here. 85 thumbs ups and counting. You guys are awesome. We appreciate you and we welcome you to the show from Tel Aviv today. Love it, love it, love it a lot. All right. We've\n",
      "We've got now 19 minutes to go and we open up for trading here. We're going to see how this market really, really generates how it goes today. By the way, I noticed a headline this morning. The Sunday game between the Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs held in New York with Taylor Swift in attendance. Two million more female viewers were watching that game. The highest rated game since the Super Bowl in NFL. That is the power of that young lady just being there. Unbelievable. The NFL offered Jennifer the chance to re-watch the game in case she hadn't seen it. Disney ESPN plus NFL. Wow. There you go. What can I say? The power that the Swifties have. Pat, what platforms are being used to write calls? Please sound off in the chat. While you guys let us know, what platforms do you guys like to use to write your options and your iron condors? Splare, don't know as well. I was just listening that there seems to be no light. Anyways, I'm halfway done. First leg is coming out of bed. Let's rock people.

      "4.13 in the afternoon where I am. I'm not sure what's going on here. It's just German holiday here, so don't be mad with me. It's good, buddy.

It's a way for me to try to give back to you guys. Thank you. Karen says, I'm used to Fidelity. Dude says, I use Tasty Trade and Vanguard. Tasty is great for advanced strategies like Iron Condors. Okay. Pat, anyone using Robinhood still? Matthew, I am using E-Trade as well. All right. JR, I have a 415, 421 and a 441, 446, October 20 Iron Condor position. 30 contracts. This is Iron Condor. It's got to be SPY. But it's still 18 days to expiry. They are up by 1260 premarket. But I'm thinking of closing because of the market direction. Well, if the direction is lower, of course, then you are going to keep an eye on that because you got a 415, 421. I hear you there. What you could also consider is a roll down on those calls where you back them off to maybe 435 to 440 or something like that. And you might then do a slight rollback on the put. Of course, the other move you could consider is going one week out to October 27 on the whole, the entire rollover and just position both sets lower. Probably bring you more money because of the time you're offering another week. And we'll give you a, you know, instead of the spread being here, it'll be here because that middle line will be higher. But look, you've got choices here. No question about it. Good idea. SPY. Yeah. Like 424.50, of course, is the premarket. So we got to obviously wait till the actual market. And let's see what the first hour gives you and just see what it does. You know, the S&P is down just 25 points in the premarket. The SPY has overcooked itself. So this might be, this might be, you know, temporary. We'll see how this plays out. All right. SPYR, honestly, even when I'm in Europe, first trade is connected to BMO Harris Bank and pretty easy for spreads. JR, the long call has only 45 cents left for depreciation. SPYR probably for condors as well. Probably pretty good to use those guys. Again, good thoughts. Good, good strategies. Like I said, you could go with that time play. You could close this out. Definitely close it out. And then you can just create a new condor two weeks down the road if you want. And, you know, lower strikes, higher credit. Away we go. And you just reposition and say, thank you, sir. May I have another? Because taking a profit is taking a profit. And if you do it, do it here and you then just create a new condor with a little more time on it and you bring both sets of contracts lower to put the market right back into the middle, then there you have it. The first hour should be entertaining. Way to go, JR. Good question. And I hope many of you are considering similar thoughts on your condors. Absolutely. I've been noticing that a number of the recommendations, a number of the trading tips that I've been throwing you guys the last week and a half, they are definitely doing well. The Apple condors I recommended, the SPYRs, triple Qs, AI and whatever others. There's definitely some profits being generated there. So, you know, you don't have to wait until I've said to wait. You don't have to wait to the end. You decide when to pull the pin and take the money off the table when it's comfortable for you. And that's it. A profit is a profit is a profit. And then move on to your next trade. That's the best part about these condors. You don't have to own any contracts of any stock. You don't have to own any shares. Riding an iron condor, as if you've taken lesson number 16, you know that the condors are perfect for smaller investors who just don't have the capital to buy up gobs of expensive stock or deepen the money calls that are very expensive. Here you just set your range on your condors. And I recommend and I urge you to really consider longer time condors with very high spreads between puts and calls, really high. Make sure that those puts and calls that you have moved into are at the extremity and that in a week to two weeks from now, they die or they become almost worthless. That is the perfect condor trading strategy, in my humble opinion. Shrinkage is your weapon, I think. All righty, there you go. Dude, it's very important for people to listen. Uncle Bruce, time is the key. Alex, Bruce, I haven't had time to email you, but I am loving life on SPY Iron Condors. They are very, very lucrative. I love to hear that. Larry, good morning, everybody from Maryland. I'm assuming you're in Maryland. How you doing, Larry? Thumbs up number 90. Thank you, my friend. We're pushing for 100 thumbs ups here. 92 are now in the house with 144 of you in the house watching. We have about 50 more people here than thumbs ups. If you could help us with a thumbs up right now, don't let Mr. Strickland catch you roaming the hallways of this channel without having given us a thumbs up. Help us out, get us over that 100 mark, maybe 110, and we'll take a shot at 150. Live from Tel Aviv, Israel, can you believe it? I'm telling you, I am just stoked that Jen and I have been able to make it here to Tel Aviv in the Holy Land. This is pretty cool stuff, I got to tell you. 98 thumbs ups, there they go. 99, we got us a Wayne Gretzky right now, and we're going for 100. The triple digits are about to happen. Thank you all so much for nailing the thumbs up button for us. Find it, hit it, pop that thing up there. There's number 100. I appreciate it. 101, here's another one. This is awesome sauce. Thank you all so much. JR, I like trading the Spiders and Triple Q index stocks. Two to three cent spreads, I like to write two to five weeks out, brings in some juicy premiums. Easy to get a wide pull call spread. That's what I'm talking about right there. I am talking about that left, right, and center. Hang on one second, I got to check something out. We are not plugged in where we should be plugged in. Let me double, triple, quadruple check. Make sure that's working. Got the wrong plug in the wrong socket, I think. Double check, triple check. What's going on, baby? Are we good? Are we good? I think we're good.\n",
      "We're going to find out in a minute. If I go off the air, you know what happened? If I go off the air, you know, we are plugged in. Okay, thank goodness. Okay, I got that alert. You're running out of power, buddy. Well, I have a plug here, but it goes to nowhere. I now know which one is where we're good. Alex jr 7819. Thumbs up always be rolling says dude, iron condors can always be rolled for a credit. There you go. Splare are all the rooms, mostly white in Tel Aviv, Bruce. I don't know. Jr. Good folding arms positions for the busy investor. Splare at least the hotel room looks so modern. Like they brought it in decade they have this hotel. I don't know if it's 10 years old might be eight. We're in a we're in a tower that's about 45 stories tall, but I don't know how many stories the hotel makes up. But we got a 15th floor view here. We're happy. Quite nice. Thing about these iron condors to give you my humble opinion on these condors, if you're going to write SP wise triple cues, just like Jr is working here, you know, you can set the spread between calls and puts on the top and bottom end, which of course, it gives you whatever exposure you want to the trade. Obviously, the further out you go from the actual level of the market, the safer you are, which means the further out in time you select an iron condor to be created. The further out the further you can go out and the further you can go out, the wider your spread could be on your pulls and calls. But I will caution you also something else to consider and that is if you write calls, if you create calls and puts on iron condors, and you are way out of the where the market is right now, you're going to find that the call or the put that you're writing, which is the bigger of the two in dollars, the credit, in other words, it might be in that dollar, $1.10 range, $1.20 range, $85, $95 range, but the other contract that you're buying to offset this one, it could be in the 20s and 30s very, very low, depending how far out you go. And the best part about the whole strategy is that a week goes by, these calls and puts that you purchased that were further out than the ones you written, they will depreciate to five and 10 cents each very quickly. And if you started off with a $10 spread between calls and puts, or more, you may find that a week from now, you may still want to be in the condor for another week. Well, at that point in time, you might be able to blow off that call that is down to very little and pick up a closer in call or put closer to the contract you wrote, call or put to lessen the spread down to $5 or $4. Because again, they're all shrinking out. It's a total decision on your part. Obviously, if you created your calls and puts, and this market was right in the middle at that time, a week goes by the market has dropped or has risen. And now there's less of a cushion on the calls or the puts, you can do rollovers and that whether the calls are being brought closer in or the puts are being brought closer into enhance your credit, that may offset the cost of the rollover on the closer in position. Less than 16 is available for purchase anytime you want it to get a handle on this and start smiling as much as a number of these other viewers are smiling in their homes. These folks aren't going to work anymore. They are living off their incomes from iron condors and option writing. Lame dog. I gave you an extra thumbs up you big good for homeless guy splur not bought built a splur and thanks for the info. Alex I agree spare this hotel room looks great. Beach boy. Uncle Bruce we've got reservations at cab back a restaurant in the old city of Jaffa. Please be ready and hungry by 730 local time forever humbly forever being humble to Auntie Jen. We'll be ready. Oh yeah. Jr. Give me your given gave you thumb 108 on my other account. Go baby go. Why that what the face is up with SoFi a wing commander. Good morning afternoon. Number 91 Uncle Bruce I bought back a bunch of GameStop cover calls for 41 cents. I wrote them for five bucks. I'm thinking of writing 20s for mid 2024. What are your thoughts? Go with go with it. Yeah, I don't have any problem telling you guys to write five six month contracts at 20 on GameStop. So what if the stock goes up? So what? What do you care? Let's go to 22 bucks a share next week. Who cares? You'll roll them. You'll roll them the next fall. You'll go higher. Go and get the money beach boy. And don't tell anyone it's a secret between us. Okay, thank you my friend splur beach boy you got deep value number 110 on the options on the thumbs up meter BP, Alex and Jr. I can't make any of the iron condors work. Lost over 500 on Nvidia iron condor tip and 360 on the first SPY tip. How are you making money? A white feather just sitting here. Grinning like a hyena. There are folks who are sitting back enjoying these trades. The key here is going out in time. Absolutely out in time and out in spread. That is the key to making money on the condors. I was seeing all having the power to roll. I was going to say also, for someone like JR and others of you, wing commander, many others. A number of you have said to me, well, Bruce, you know, I took your advice and two weeks ago, I did an iron condor on the queues and the SPYs and some stocks. I did those for a month out. Then a week later, I did more iron condors for a month out. Then a week later, I did more for a month out. I've got five, six series of condors out there. Now some of you only write condors on SPYs. Some of you only do condors on queues. Some of you only want to do condors on Tesla. It's up to you what turns you on and what you're comfortable with. But I can see down the road, a few months from now, there will be dozens and dozens of you here who will have 10, 12 condors on the go at the same time. I absolutely see it happening, where you'll have condors that expire in two weeks, two and a half weeks, three weeks, three and a half weeks, four weeks, four and a half weeks, five weeks, on several different entities at the same time. You're going to be very busy. You're going to be very active. And you're going to be hauling in a bunch of money. And that is the secret to this business. You start with one and graduate out from there. There you go. Splare, it's only tricky if the option is sitting too far out. And the rollover possibilities are not there. But January 24, April should be safe. The next two third Fridays with calls up here. There you go. Remember these triple queues and SPYs, new iron condor positions, and opportunities being created every week, every day. So you can get into a whole bunch of these. Just be patient and fold your arms once you make your positions, fold your arms, take your profits when they're handed to you and then roll into a new set of condors. Rinse and repeat people all day long. Why not? All right, there you go. BP, Splare, the only problem is having enough cash, iron condors in time when all other shares drop to no margin capital to buy back. So cannot do rollover. Larry, Titus, Bruce, boom, we are open right now for trading. We're up and we're running at 4.30 in Tel Aviv. It is 3.30 in continental Europe. It is 2.30 in the UK. It is I believe 10.30 in New York, if I am not mistaken. 9.30 in New York, pardon me. And at 7.30 in Calgary, the markets are open for the bidness. And I welcome you all to the channel, the show, the hopes, the dreams, aspirations of all of you. I want you to get rich, rich, rich. I see the Dow down 133 in the early going. We'll follow that as we settle in here. Splare, leave half of money in worst case rollover features. BP, I've watched Less than 60 but cannot make it work, says BP. We're now at 128 on the dip on the Dow. We've got SPY is only $1.85 lower. That's, again, becoming a little more realistic with the market. Q's are down 222. GameStop down 24. SoFi down 13. Apple is down $1.11. We've got Netflix down $3.46. AI down 29 cents. Nvidia is up $1.25. Tesla down $3.46. Rocket Lab down 4.9 cents. Matterport down a penny. SmartRank\n",
      "Goldman up two, we got ATIP up a quarter here, Unity down 56 cents, Google down 67, Moderna down 57, Cisco down 24, Pfizer down 12, IBM is down nine, HPQ up 61 cents, Microsoft down 111, ME down one and a half, Amazon down $1.44, Spire down four cents maybe, Home Depot down 262, Vanek is off 84 cents, Goldman down 370, Boeing is up 129, Meta down 292, Target Corporation up 16 cents, JP Morgan Chase down 67 cents, Costco up 138, Walmart down six, Disney down 68, American Airlines down 11, DraftKings down 17, AMC down a dime, Royal Caribbean down 144. So it's red, yeah, we figured that, it's been red all morning. The question is how far, how long, and we'll see just what kind of intensity they have. All right. There you go, kids. Let's see what else is going on. Thank you all, JR roll, sorry, JR, Tesla and NVIDIA have juicy premiums, but they are very volatile. Better to write on SPYH and triple Qs for the widespread and then fold your arms. JR, roll only when one of the long legs is breached by the stock price, then make sure your new premium rolls for a credit. It takes time and yes, antigen, it takes powder. There you have it. There you go. It's a learning curve and it's done over time and you start carefully and you cautiously move from there. Thank you all for those of you patient enough and those of you who've taken my classes, some of you have had one-on-ones with me to help you get it straight. Well done, everybody. It can be done. We are now only down 118 on the Dow, maybe 128. We're not down 200 points or anything like that. We've got SPYDR down 192 at the moment. And let's take a look at this U.S. market, 130 for the Dow, 20 for S&P. So the SPYDRs are going to come up a little bit, I think, NASDAQ down 77 and we got oil up 48 cents right now. All right. And SPYDR says, I've been using for one year my GameStop to gain on it and I covered already more than the value of the complete position just from GameStop. Manager, I gave some thought to do some iron condors as well. So I did the morning tip on queues and I got $1.29 credit. Splare, it's getting only horrible when you cash out too much of the call money, but then there's time and they're not much worth during the last days. Perfect to buy back, says Splare. We've got SPYDR down 211 at the moment. Queues are down $2. We're at 425.20 on SPYDRs. Queues are 359.26. GameStop only down 13 cents. SoFi down 18, Apple down just 90 cents. We don't have any single disasters on our hand or anything like that. Okay. JR says, AI has been good to me this way. I've done well. Yeah, good premiums on AI have been had. Definitely around here. Cheers to all of you from Tel Aviv, Israel. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you for those of you giving us thumbs ups and letting us know you're here and how you're doing. It's been great to see you. Great to have you here with us. We have 113 thumbs ups, well in the triple digits, and they're still coming in. Thank you everyone for your support today. And yeah, Splare's got it right. You just have to leave some cash for the calls, at least half of it when there's two to three months out. Good advice. Absolutely. 138 is the down dip on the Dow. That's only 0.39 of a percentage point. It's not serious. We got S&P down 0.45. We've got NASDAQ down 0.62. Oil up 0.55 at the moment. And we got Treasury yields hitting new highs and that is hurting the markets. We have a 10-year Treasury note now paying off at 4.725%. The two years are over 5%. The U.S. dollar has been climbing against everything. The Euro is down to 104.7. The pound is at 120.79, down from 122. So U.S. dollar climbing. Interest rates climbing. Stock markets suffering. Not like terribly, but it's kind of like every day down, down, down. We've had a three-month slump in the markets. The question is, when does it do the turnaround? That's what we wonder. 160 is the dip on the Dow right now. 21 in S&P. 76 on NASDAQ. Okay. JR. I can get a good 10, 15 cent difference on buybacks versus new sell position. And voila, a great credit to roll this thing. Splayer, I, for example, buy always one call back, wait till I get a better chance. Then when it's written, you can get buyback the second one and so on. Splayer, but for that strategy, it's helpful when you don't write all the calls for the same date. Yes, Splayer is busy with his trades. Adobe down 222. Spiders down two. Q's only down 178 right now. GameStop off just 18 cents. 15.21 on GameStop. Sovi down 26 at 758. We got Apple only off 74. And Netflix down 311. AI down 38 cents at 24.32. NVIDIA is actually up 277. Tessa down 380. Rocket Lab down seven and a half cents. Unity down 51. Google down 74. Moderna down a buck. Cisco down 24. Pfizer off 13. IBM is up eight. Now it's up 17. And HPQ is up 80 today. HPQ is up 80 cents. Microsoft down 146. Amazon down $1.35. Spire unchanged. Home Depot down 383. Vanik down 23 cents. Goldman down six bucks. Boeing up 290 at $190, 72 cents. Meta down 186. Target up 95. JP Morgan down a buck nine. Costco up 70. Walmart down a penny. So it's not negative everywhere and it's not negative in a big way at all, really, for this market right now. JR, wow, my spiders made a turnaround here, but no legs are in the money. So folding those arms at a little turnaround this time. JR down 189 at 425. No worries where you are right now. And time is your friend. It's your best friend. BP, guys, with the markets in the red. Day after day, I have no spare cash to buy back. And Yarn Congress will always have lost money when it expired, says BP. There you go. 146 dip on the Dow and we're down 17 on S&P. It's only 0.41. NASDAQ's improving some points. It's only down 66 points. Oil only up 49. It's backing off as well. Okay, there's the story. Good to have you here today. Great to see you all live from Israel, Tel Aviv, Israel. We're here. I can see the Mediterranean Sea. It's just over here, about a mile away. Was looking out the airplane window on the way down here. Looking at the Mediterranean and the different Greek islands. About 45 minutes out, that was the end of those. Then it was just sea only, but it was kind of neat to go through, go over Europe, south of Vienna, and over, I guess, Slovakia, and then towards Turkey and Greece. And here we are in Israel. It's the furthest south I've been on this side of the Atlantic, that is for sure. And so far, so good. Jen and I noticed the humidity when we landed here. It was quite humid and warm, but it thankfully is not as hot as it was a month or so ago. We were looking at the weather a little while. We were plotting our big trip to Europe, and we started plotting a trip here to Tel Aviv. We were looking at those daily highs in the mid to high 90s and thought, oh no, the humidity, that's gonna be terrible. But we're in the mid 80s. Low to mid 80s. So of course we're inside an air conditioned comfort zone. We're doing okay. It's all right. B.W., the word of the day. Kibbutz, joy of the holy land, Uncle Bruce and Auntie Jen. Alex, BP, it sounds like you're writing too many. You have liquidity problems when trying to buy back. Also try to bring in similar credits to the calls and puts. J.R., good rule of thumb. Best to write only 50 to 65% of my account balance. Gives me powder to work with when there needs to be a rollover. Yeah, it's slower, but keeps me out of losing positions for sure, absolutely. And I don't get margin calls. There you go. Dude, the key is rolling. Roll out for a credit. Look out two months, even if needed. Also make sure there's at least three bucks between the legs, perhaps as much as $20. Splatter, when I write a spread with a $2 difference, I try to keep 300 in my portfolio. 200 goes as an insurance. Then as soon as the write goes down, I buy it with the other 100, best case. Alex, so that if either side goes in the money, you have a 50%, you have a 50% of your profit locked in on the other side of the.\n",
      "trade, then roll by selling more time. Exactly right. It's exactly right. Splare. Then I write new against the bought call two weeks more time and I write again. BP, Alex, I only wrote one condor on NVIDIA. I lost £500, one spider. I lost £350. BP, so only two iron condors I've ever written. There you go. There's some comments there. Further out in time, further out with the spreads, way further up. You got to go way, way up. If you can bring in credits of 80 cents to $1.20 on queues or SPYs by going way out, that might be the way to go. You want to be safely away from this market. And if you're out five weeks, four weeks with a big spread like that, those contracts will depreciate out because they're too far out with too little time in a week or two from now. But you got to have some capital. There's no way around it. Dude, limit your iron condor rights if you're low on cash. I keep it around 56% in cash. Beach Boy, yeah, no lamps, but certainly air conditioning everywhere in Tel Aviv. There is air conditioning everywhere here in the Mideast. I can sure see why. You can feel it. You know why, kids. But yeah, boy, I'll tell you, this city, Tel Aviv, boy oh boy. Cranes, construction cranes all over the place. Just absolutely amazing. The building that's going on and these projects are really huge, tall structures. Condos and office towers everywhere. It's amazing. Oh, we're down 100 points on the Dow. We have come back a bit here. We're only off 20 on S&P, 87 on NASDAQ. Watching this market. We got GameStop sitting around 15, 14, down 24 cents. SoFi down 36 at 748. Apple down 71 to start the morning. But the question is, is there going to be a buy wave coming here to grab some profit taking and some speculation on some upticks that could turn everything here into green in no time? Because they're not down very much. Netflix down 260. AI down 63 cents. NVIDIA down a dollar. That's nothing. Tesla down 450. Let's see here. Google down 85 cents. Unity down 77. Moderna down 7. Cisco down 36. Pfizer down 9 cents. IBM up 43. It's going higher. HPQ up 75. Microsoft down 206. Amazon down 207. Let's see here. Goldman down 565. Boeing is up 314. That's doing all right. Meta down 219. Target up 114. JP Morgan down 97 cents. Costco up 319. Walmart gone green now up 50. Disney down 63 cents. American Airlines down 9. DraftKings down 35 cents. AMC down 8. Royal Caribbean down 132. Not a lot of serious negatives. We're down 90 on the down now. Let's see here. I had on spreads an identical issue. Luckily, there was enough ATIP around 9. So I sold them for changing my written call. It's getting me again some extra dollars to buy back the second right. JR, I agree with Splair and Alex. Being that far out gives you the time to make good positions with much wider put and call spreads. JR, if things go sideways, one can close with a small profit and set another position or just wait it out. 45 days seems to be a great sweet spot. Dude, I write about 10 to 15 iron condors. I'm a given cycle with 25,000 cash. Buying power used to be buying powder. Power used right now about 12,000. Avoid getting close to a margin call. Splair, but this again needs the right dates on spreads. BW, NVIDIA, Intel, HPQ are the only tickers trying to hold the markets up this morning. Only green on the heat map of consequence. Splair, I prefer to take one month on written side and two months on bot side. The time shrinkage on written calls makes you gain anyways. There you go. 108 dip on the Dow. Adobe down 450. Spiders only down 188. Q's are only down 188. GameStop down 32. SoFi down 34. Apple down 63. That's it right here in this opening 15 minutes of trading today, everybody. That's what I've got. Thank you all for joining in with me today. 114 thumbs ups in the house. I appreciate that. And welcome all to the show coming live to you today from Tel Aviv in Israel. Pretty cool to look out this window and see stuff. See stuff we've never seen before. It's pretty cool. A hood which with which we're not familiar. Loving it. Fantastic. Anyway, there you go. 94 drop on the Dow. That's all. 16 on S&P, 80 on NASDAQ. We're not falling off from here. We're just kind of drifting along here. Not really dropping that much, which begs the question, is there a byweight building that will take out the sellers? Because if the sellers don't keep dropping this market, she'll bounce up the other direction. That's my guess. And JR saying, wow, spiders were down 1400 and return plus 6960. Still folding arms roller coaster time. I'm still 440 away from the stock price coming even close to my short legs. So I'm just folding my arms here. Yeah, definitely not. Not really backing off now down 163. The spiders are actually climbing here. Bit by bit. Q's are down two bucks spiders down 160. The Dow off 87 points. Yeah, we're definitely improving here. A little by little. Excuse me. Oil down. Oil is up 32 cents. It's down from being plus 50. It's only up 32. Oil is backing up. 89.14 a barrel in Texas. Under 90. JR, I like to watch the ES futures. Gives a good indication of the direction of the market. Okay. Rock and roll. Yep. 97 point drop on the Dow at this point is our current situation. The situation as we like to say. And spiders are down 167 at the moment. Okay. GameStop down 45, 1494. And SoFi down 31, 753. Apple down 78. Okay. There you go. Alrighty, let's see what else we got over here. Let's take a look at some other headlines. Wall Street Journal. tougher return to office rules are not filling buildings. Interesting. And House Democrats could decide Kevin McCarthy's fate. Alrighty, Wall Street thinks America's homes are overvalued. Criminal gangs exploit security gaps to infiltrate airports. GM and Ford are going to lay off about 500 factory workers. Trump fumes as civil fraud trial starts new phase of legal peril. Millennials on better track for retirement than boomers and Gen X. Interesting. Americans growing reluctance to quit jobs. Workers are voluntarily leaving their positions at near 2019 rates after a record job switching in recent rates. So that's interesting. Always interesting stuff going on out here. Congressman's car stolen at gunpoint in Washington. Yeah, interesting. Supreme Court case could up end rules for mortgages and credit cards. A group of payday lenders are set to argue that some rules written by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are invalid, because the agency funding system is unconstitutional. There you go. I wonder if they're in the they're gonna make it easier for people to repay their loans are more difficult and more expensive. Gee, I wonder. Well, we'll see what happens. Okay. Taylor Swift, the heiress tour sets presales records for Cinemark. Cinemark Holdings is seeing record demand for the Taylor Swift, the heiress tour concert film, which hits theaters October the 13th in 10 days. Domestic presales for the concert film are more than 10 times higher than the exhibitor has seen for any\n",

      "would be Golden Saks down 2%, Home Depot down 1.75%, 3M down 0.75%, same with Merck, we're down 0.25% with Cisco and Microsoft, Coca-Cola down 0.6%, JP Morgan down 0.6%, Salesforce down 0.5%. Winners, Boeing up 2%, Intel up 1.6%, Nike is up 1.3%, Dow Chemical up 0.8%, Walgreens is up 0.78%, Procter & Gamble 0.61%, IBM 0.31%. We've got about 9 winners, 21 losers with the Dow off right now, approximately 120-odd points. I can't tell you why, can't tell you how, but that's what they're showing here. Excuse me. There we go. There we go, 132, 113 on the Dow, a little recovery coming in right at the moment. Don't quite know what to make of that. JR, oops, did it again, falling off a cliff. Spiders down 2.19% at the moment. Excuse me. Dow off 1.60% right now, and S&P down 26%, Nasdaq down 1.08%. We have a sell wave going through right now. BW, holy crap, look at the spike in the DXY right now. Wonder where it wants to go. Up, up and up. The VIX is at 1850, up 0.89% today. So that's negative on the index there. Okay. Breaking news, U.S. job openings rise to $9.5M in August from $8.9M. More job openings, 600,000 more job openings in the U.S. Splayer, thanks for the info, JR and BP. What I've said is not for a rush. I'm here as well as low capital time is a key, the right education. Got to be disciplined. JR, as a peanut would say, what the heck, what the hay is that? Thanks, JR. Thanks for helping out. We're down 1.55% on the Dow. I guess, seems to be, looks like it's down 1.55%. GameStop, 1,488. Right there, 1,488, 1.47% on the Dow, 26 SP, 1.12% on NASDAQ. Okay, kids. All right. 2.35% drop on the SPDRs, 2.70% on Qs. GameStop down 54% to 1,485. We're down 27% on SOFI, 7.57%. Apple down 1.61%. We're getting negative, definitely getting more negative there. Netflix still up 6.30%, but it's off about $4 from where we were a few minutes ago. AI down 42%, NVIDIA down 96%, Tesla down $4. Elsewhere, Unity down 64%, Google down 110%, Moderna down 59%. So, got some red showing up right now. A little cell wave just kicked right on in there, right on in there, pardon me. I don't know why, it just did. Which of course brought on a hiccuping episode here in Tel Aviv. I don't know. Uncle Ruz, you need to watch Jeff Dunham and Peanut. You'll fall off your chair. There you go. I think I have seen clips of those two guys. Hasn't Jeff done that for like decades? He started in his 20s. He's still doing it in his 50s, I bet you. Probably made millions of dollars doing that. He used to be in Vegas, I think. Oh, and probably still does Vegas. And I'm sure he does Biloxi, Mississippi and all kinds of casinos everywhere. Yeah, I'm sure he's active. He's got his gig. He's got his gig and he's doing his gig. That's all he's doing. Yeah. Down $1.90 on the Dow. We're still dropping here. I don't know why the Dow is dropping, but it is. Social Security cost of living increase will be announced in nine days, October the 12th. Headline just came through. That just came out. All right, everybody. What can I say? I don't know. What more can I say? I mean, what more can I say? There we have it. The Euro at 104.54, dropping the pound 120.64. Definitely having a dump. Canadian dollar just had a drop here. Good. Almost a penny in not very long a time frame. I don't know what's going on. The US dollar is surging against everybody right now. Like right now. Don't know why this is happening, but it's happening. Something going on. Somebody said something. I'll tell you that right now. Okay. Somebody said something. I don't know what somebody said, but somebody said something. Okay. And over there I go. $14.80 on GameStop. And on interest rates, the 10-year Treasury, 4.75%. That's climbing again. That is going higher. Climbing in the UK. Climbing in Spain, like in the last 10 minutes. Italy's rates are going higher. Germany's interest rates are going higher. And the US rates are definitely going higher, from 4.70 to 4.75. I don't know why. US, the euro is at the low of the day. The pound is definitely falling here. I just, I don't know what's going on. Something's happening. Wish I could tell you what it was. the Dow. Yep. The only headline, US job openings, 9.6 million. That's a strong jobs market. Don't know why the Dow would be down on that, unless people are thinking higher jobs market, more inflation, higher interest rates. Is that the reason? I can't. I don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Splayer says, I still have a call left to write. Slow study. I think it went 14 in the money January call. We'll do it. BP. Uncle Bruce looks like all the SPACs have been loss makers.

Dang, what spooked the markets? I don't know. BW, S&P below 4200. Watch out below. May happen this week. This keeps up. Guess the market has realized we are in a recession and rates are going to go up 10% sooner or later. Markets are on thin ice. Deep value options. Ken Griffin is upset about the GameStop movie. That's why the market dipped. Ah, you see, it's all Ken Griffin's fault. He's upset. We're down 229 on endow. Thank you, Ken Griffin. It's your fault. You did it. Okay. We're at 124 thumbs ups.

We're at 171 on Apple And you can write condors on Apple a month out or longer and you can get some really nice spreads between calls and puts and I think you can make some nice money on Apple condors my personal opinion Netflix up 270 we were up $11 AI down 68 and video down to 30 Tesla down five bucks Rocket lab down eight and a half. How's that? Am you doing for our friend manager? Only up 50 cents.

We're down 303 on the Dow Jr. I got five poor man cover calls on GameStop that deep in the money calls are losing more than I'm gaining On the short calls stupid GameStop still have 472 days to see what happens Well, that's where you buy back those calls you wrote and write some more for more premium Brian laughing out loud Jr Counting the days my deep in the money's are down 50% all while good thing games up with a roller coaster and highly predictable or unpredictable splitter I was if you don't have to Would you write today a new call or would you wait for a little pop in the upcoming days? Probably your answer is always right, right, right. Yeah, you should be writing BW 10-year hits 475.4 ain't been this high since October of 07. Hmm. What happened in 0809 G I wonder did the markets go boom or bust back then? Jr. Brian will we be in the same boat nothing to do but pull in a little profit while I wait Brian, yeah, I can't write on this red madness. We'll just fold my arms and I'm just going to wait.

We're down 179 on Nasdaq Okay oil only up 24 cents it's backing up What can I say It's doing what it's doing game stop 1465. So if I 744 Apple 171 06 there you go Well, you know, this is the kind of scenario where if you're an iron condor writer You want to take a look at maybe creating an iron condor right now, it's at the lows of the day you want to take a condor that's giving you time and a big spread between down and up and Do it at the low of the day You may find that there's a partial recovery later today and that automatically gives you protection against the downside risk I don't know. Just just saying you've waited 50 odd minutes to make your move on a condor Govern yourself accordingly. Why not? 191 291 drop on the Dow right now I'm in no rushes Brian uncle Bruce has taught us Well, JR is giving you a thumbs up on that right so far is down 5% to yucky T poo Yeah, what are you gonna do? Yuckity poo it's down to there. You have it Markets fluctuate that's what they do Yes, indeed If you've written calls on stocks and they're backing off Time to take profits here Always be writing and score when you can score why not? 14 66 on the game stop shares 1460 below the day 1462 Okay All right. All right.

      "Okay, Dow's only off 260, 250 now on the Dow, 50 point recovery. Don't know if it's real or partial or temporary. See what it wants to do. BW, a GME broke down through 1541, a low that was hit back on 1923. Where's the floor on this one? 1466 is where we're at right now, I don't know. But that's where we're at. 1466, the 30-year Treasury yield jumps to a 16-year high of almost 4.9%, 16 years since we've been here. The low interest rate game was a long, long game. My God, 07, 08, the Treasury Fed stepped in and lowered rates big time, big time to handle what that fallout, the economic fallout, the financial meltdown of 07, 08, 09. My goodness, it's been a while, it's been a long time. Giddy up, kids, giddy up. Down 259 on the Dow Jones markets. Matthew, if I survive this, I'm doing things much differently next time. I promise I won't piss it away, Lord. Give me another boom, please. I promise I won't blow it the next time. Oh my, we got some cloud cover coming in to Tel Aviv, a little bit here, a little bit there. I can open up the curtain a little bit, let some more light in. I can see out there, see what's going on out there. Man, oh man, Tel Aviv, Israel, everybody, we're in Tel Aviv. Welcome, all of you from Tel Aviv. 134 thumbs ups, thank you very much. We're coming in to the last six, seven minutes of our show. I want to thank you all for joining us from wherever in the world you are. Thank you all. We've done some traveling on this trip, Jennifer and I, we've done some traveling. We started in the UK and ended up in Germany and Denmark and Sweden. And we ended up in Austria and Vienna. Now we're in Israel. Going to head to Switzerland, back to Germany, and then we're going to a country called New Jersey. You ever heard of that country? Secaucus, New Jersey, as a matter of fact. October 21, meet and greet, the Harmony Suites Hotel. Looking forward to seeing you kids there. Kind of one to five, I think it's going to end up being like a one to five kind of get together. Something like that, just having a chat with the hotel about their rooms and stuff. Look forward to having you there. Come and join us in Secaucus, New Jersey at the Harmony Suites live. Let me know with an email if you're coming so I can add to the totals, because I just want to make sure I get a room that's big enough. Not too big, not too small, just right. Thank you all. Appreciate you coming and coming to see us. BW, did they leave the rates low too long? Of course, that can't be sustainable, not retail to conventional rates. All institutions did too, with rates hitting 5.5%. A lot of them are in trouble. Dude, Matthew, roll those spreads, baby. Profit manager, I'll be buying more. Sofi, once I lock in profit on this MU short, yeehaw. JR, I had to school some peeps online who thought that the TGT kerfuffle would bankrupt the company. Markets fluctuates, peeps, always. And Splare, say what, when, then, I wish you already relaxed. Jen, everybody enjoy the meal. Thank you, my friend. Yeah, you know, interest rates were down a long time globally, and that party is over. That party ended, and we've got issues now. A lot of reasons why there's inflation, not a single reason for Joe Biden's fault. Not one. Or Pierre Trudeau, he's not the reason either. It's not your local prime minister or your president. It's not your politicians creating inflation. Think again. But, you know, everyone wants to grab a headline any way they can and use it for themselves. JR, hey, Uncle Bruce, I'll bring some Mountain Lakes, New Jersey bagels your way if you can handle it. They are some of the best in the country. Oh, by all means, bring bagels, baby. Bring some bagels. That'll be a lot of fun. People are bringing pies, I think. At least people said they were bringing pies. We'll see if they actually show up with pies. Apparently, Costco in Canada has pumpkin pie right now. Pumpkin pie in Calgary. Jen and I are dying out here. There are no pumpkins anywhere in Israel. What's that? Canadian Thanksgiving is coming up, and that's why there's pumpkin pies at Costco. Are we there just before or after? I think just after. We might miss it. We might have to send our daughter in. No, we can't do that. We can't send her. I think we have pumpkin pie now until after Christmas. No, there's a gap. Oh, is there? Yeah, I'm going to have to send my cousin. I'm going to have to send an emergency message to my cousin. I'm going to tell him to get his butt. It better be pie in our refrigerator. I'm going to tell him to get his butt over to Costco for me. Pick up at least two pumpkin pies because the first one won't last barely a couple of days. We'll have some pumpkin pie waiting for us when we get home. Absolutely. This is an emergency. This is serious stuff. This is of national importance. JR, are you an everything bagel guy? I can be, but I love sesame seed bagels. Or onion bagels. No, Jen likes onion bagels. I love sesame seed. Everything onion, a little too much, but can be done. Manager, how's the MU short going for you? Dude, try baba ganoush. Baba ganoush is just like pumpkin pie filling, I swear. Trust me. Baba ganoush. Baba ganoush is not the same as pumpkin pie filling. Auntie Jen's calling you out. Dude, you're being called out by Auntie Jen here. Oh, my goodness. She's going, nice try, buddy. Yikes. Brian says, Uncle Bruce likes sesame seed bagels. Bingo, Costco sesame seed bagels. We cut them in half, and we toast them to get those sesame seeds to roast. Oh, my gosh. BW eggplant is not pumpkin. There you go, Brian. Everything's my favorite, says Brian. Everything bagel is my favorite. Rock and roll. Yeah, Jennifer likes baba ganoush, but it ain't no pumpkin pie. There you go. I'm in the land of mamas and all of it in the breakfast buffet. Oh, man. We were in the breakfast buffet here at the hotel. It was pretty nice. But you know what I couldn't find? I found the scrambled eggs. I found the boiled eggs. They'll make you an omelet. They'll fry your eggs any way you want it. There's something I couldn't find here, several things I couldn't find. But I found waffles and pancakes. Couldn't find my muesli. I tried granola today. It was all right, but I love my muesli. Oh, they said they had a container of maple syrup for your waffle. In Canada, we don't call that maple syrup. We call that corn syrup. Yeah, we use that to, you know, clog drains. Yeah, what can I say? What can I say? What else is going on here? Constantine, Uncle Bruce was writing condors. It is still a good idea to buy deep-in-the-money calls. Is it still a good idea to buy deep-in-the-money calls? Iron condors? You don't buy deep-in-the-money calls with iron condors. What are you talking about? You write out-of-the-money calls with condors. You don't buy anything deep-in-the-money. Constantine, what are you asking me? BW, baba is good, but you need it with other stuff like feta and meat. Dude, whoops, I have been bad. Run for it, says dude. Splare, I love tabbouleh, a bulgur tomato and herbs. But I actually forgot how. There was tabbouleh in the buffet. Petersili is called in English. Petersili is called in English. And, of course, a lot of lime on top of it. Spicy Android number 134. I have always pressed a juicy of an extra lemon to get a better taste of my delivered tabbouleh. Spicy Android. I just got on. Should I write on GameStop right now or wait? Always be writing. Always be writing. Always be writing. 1473 on GameStop. Low the day on the GameStop today has been 1457.\n",
      "So, we've come up a bit here. SoFi, 742. The low of the day, 741. And the Dow is now, again, down 300 points for yet another run. That's what's going on. And we're down 46 on S&P. We're down 183 on NASDAQ at the moment. McCormick Stock suffers worst day in more than three years as weaker China recovery blamed for sales miss. Okay. There you go. Netflix plans to increase the price of ad-free service once the actor strike ends, Wall Street Journal is reporting. There you go. We may have to cancel our Netflix membership. We don't use it enough. Do we? I mean, we really. We don't, but I'll do it. Yeah. Let's see. There's a reason we have it, right? Right over there. I'm too busy doing this. Anyway, what can I say? Okay. Okay. Constance. Sorry, Uncle Bruce. It came up wrong. Knowing how to write iron condors, is it still a good idea as another trade to buy deep into money calls? Yes, it is. It's always a good idea to buy deep into money calls if you're going to write calls against them for poor man covered call strategies. Of course it is. But it depends on what stock, what price, how long, 90-10 rule, all of that. Sorry, Clint. Yeah, I know you were on there. Asked it as well but I was knowing that he says the same like always in that case, always be writing the big E. Neat! Neat! Neat! Neat! Neat! Neat! Neat! Manager JR, check Discord, buddy.

      "Okay, we're here. Hey everybody. How you doing today? It's your buddy Uncle Bruce with StockMarkets with Bruce. For those of you who've never been here before, welcome to the channel. For those of you who somehow stumbled upon me by mistake, what can I tell you? What we do here is I talk about the stock market in plain English. I do that as best I can. Try to explain to you what's going on out there. And I also talk to folks here on this channel about how you can bring some money in to your account with what you're sitting on. Writing options on stock you got or ETFs or options that you're holding that are in the money, writing poor man covered calls, learning how to write what we\n",

      "35736:You are the stock analyst. I will give you a YouTube video transcript, a text delimited by triple backticks.The transcript contains daily updates on the stock market, advice on option trading strategies, and personal life stories. You should summarise the text focusing on stocks.\n",

      "call cash secured puts where you don't even have to own stock to write options and bring in money. Or the fait accompli, how to create an iron condor where you don't own any stock and yet you kind of think you have an idea where the market is going to be for a little while, like the next week or two or three. You feel like well, Tesla won't go any higher than that, won't go any lower than that. You can create an option program using iron condors where you make money if the stock doesn't go above or below a certain price point. You do not need to own any stock to be an option writer. Of all the people out there that invest, and there are millions and millions and millions that are investors, whether they're passive or aggressive or active or not, there are definitely millions of people out there who invest in options. They try to make money buying options and hope they hit the jackpot, that their stock goes running up, like they're looking for dumb money payoffs like GameStop. They hope to buy an option for a buck and it goes to $100 a contract. And then there are a lot of folks out there who, they buy contracts and sell contracts, especially call contracts where they are betting on a stock's movement higher over a few days or weeks or months and they'll put, you know, $1,000 on the table, five grand, 20, 50,000, 150,000, depending on the size of the investor. And there are institutions that put millions into this game. Betting on and trying to earn a return on a very leveraged trade, because one option contract represents 100 shares of stock. Well, you know, if you think Apple's going to go up 20 bucks a share in the next three months because they're going to have good earnings or you like their iPhone or you think their new MacBook Pro is going to be the best thing ever, there are people out there who are gambling on these issues and they'll buy these call options. What I try to tell my viewers to do is the opposite. I'm like a George Costanza here. I just tell my viewers, why don't you be George Costanza and go the other direction and let the gamblers who are the buyers of these contracts take all the risk and you take very little risk. Like how about less than 20% risk, less than 10% risk that you're not going to make money. And let these gamblers take all the shots and go nuts because they're out there. Oh, believe me, they're out there. The thing you have to understand if you're not a regular of this channel, you don't follow me very often, is that the pool, the number of people getting into the market is growing dramatically, especially outside of the United States and Canada. There's no question that a lot of Americans love playing the stock market. People of a certain age catch into it. But in the third world or the second world, maybe there are probably 100 countries out there after the G20, the top 20 economies of the world, the next 100 most lucrative economies of the planet. There are a ton of people trying to get ahead and trying to make a few bucks in the market. And the reason that they're coming into the market is because it is so easy for them to now do it. When I was a stockbroker in 1979 until I stopped being an investment advisor in the 2000s, right up until my last gig when I was an offshore asset manager in the Cayman Islands, I used to have to write down my trades in writing pretty well. And I used to have to make phone calls to call traders to get trades done. Today, people use this little device right here. It's called a smartphone. This is my little Apple that I use. This is the instrument that people use around the planet to do all their business now. And it's incredible. I'm in Tel Aviv at the moment, as I said earlier, and went out last night for a bite to eat there. We were in a neighborhood that is classically middle class, active, socially active place. Everybody's got their cell phone going. And there are people there talking, texting, you name it, through this technology. And of course, you've ever taken a flight lately on an airplane? How many people are frantically using this thing at the check-in gate before they have to shut it off? The first thing you do when you land your plane, turn your phone back on. There are millions and millions of people who want to become investors in the market. They don't have millions of dollars each. They have hundreds or thousands of dollars each. And the best part about this technology and the platform trading firms that now exist all over the planet, they give people access to stocks and options in New York, Chicago and elsewhere. And this is where you can come in and you can score some nice returns. Because frankly, I hate to say it, but it's true. There are a lot of people coming into this market now and will for the next 15 and 20 years. Remember, baby boomers like me are aging out and the kids behind me are coming in. The kids coming in now to trade stocks and options, these 20-year-olds and 25-year-olds and 30-year-olds and so on, they don't have at their disposal what my clients would have had in the 80s at their disposal. In the 80s, they would have needed a stockbroker to be able to help them buy and sell stock. Well, the stockbroker, which was me and others like me, we were all licensed by our securities exchanges commissions to do what we did. We all had to pass exams. We all had to have courses. We all had to have some knowledge of the markets. And we were just drilled into our heads. We were drilled by our superiors about not taking crazy risks with our clients' money. And so we would get phone calls all the time from our clients going, I heard a hot rumour on so-and-so or a hot tip on this stock. And what they would do is they'd say to me, Bruce, can you check it out for me? Can you check it out for me? And that was my job was to keep my customers away from trouble. And the more I did that, the more I saved them grief and dire consequences. I saw stockbrokers not be as diligent as I was. They would take any order from any customer. They didn't care what they wanted to do. They would just let them go wild because these guys were commission hogs. They just wanted to make commissions. They didn't care if the customers lost money or not because they felt that they could always get another customer. This guy blew his brains out on his investments. I was the opposite. I was taking the long-term view that, I want to deal with my clients over a longer term and I want to secure all of their confidence. I want to understand what they're about. I want them to understand what I'm about. And I want to deal with their trading money. We call it the bad money and their retirement money and their family's money and their relatives' money. And in other words, I want it to be like the insurance agent used to be, or your local branch manager used to be in your town, or your parents' town, or your grandparents' town, where there's the bank, there's the insurance company, and there's the investment company. And each had their functions. And when I grew up into the brokerage business in the late 70s and 80s, I got to know individuals that had been stockbrokers for 20 and 30 years, through good times and bad, for entire families and relatives. In other words, these guys didn't need to get on the telephone and find new customers all the time because they kept coming to them. Everyone would recommend their favorite broker to their friends and relatives. And so when time would go by and these brokers were dealing with grandma and grandpa, mom and dad, and now the kids. And these 50 and 60-year-old stockbrokers were making a ton of money in commissions because they were dealing with 1,000 clients. They would have one or two assistants helping them to handle all the phone calls. And they were making the equivalent today of a half a million to a million dollars a year in commissions to them. They were making a very, very good living. I wanted to be one of those guys. Unfortunately, in today's world, you newbies and the newbies that are out there that are desperately trying to get.\n",
      "into this market, they don't have that kind of person to go to. If you don't have at least a million bucks, you're probably not very welcome into any brokerage firm anywhere, because there aren't any anymore. Guys like me have been put out to pasture. The big banks and the huge investment firms in Wall Street and in Frankfurt and Tokyo and London, they've consolidated the business into these massive companies. And these trading platforms I keep referring to on these phones, are controlled by big money outfits. And at the end of the day, it's a volume business. That's all it is. And all they're wanting to do is to get you to sign up, open an account and get anyone else to sign up and open an account. Throw in electronically 1000 bucks, 5000 bucks, 50000 bucks, and all they want you to do is trade it and they don't care how you figure it out. And they'll give you online courses and they'll show you YouTube videos on how to trade and how to do this. But you have no one to talk to for advice. You're on your own kids. And this is where you guys who are watching me right now can make an absolute fortune on this stock market because the competition you're up against is so undereducated that if you give yourself any kind of instruction, you're going to be ahead of 51% of the competition, putting you in the top half of knowledge traders, traders with knowledge. And you will quickly move into the top 40 percentile, the top third percentile, the top 80 percentile. You'll be in the top 10% in no time. You'll have more knowledge than the rest of the market. This is where you will make money because you won't make mistakes. Your mistakes are one offs or occasional and they're not going to wipe you out where you're going to notice people come and go in the marketplace all the time. You'll find out at your next family reunion or your next next time you see someone at work or next time you get together your buddies on a golf course or at the club or whatever. You're going to you're hearing a rumor. Oh yeah. You hear about Tony. Yeah. Tony lost 20 grand in the market trying to do this and that. Did you hear about Fred? Yeah. Fred tried to invest and lost all his money. You're going to hear that kind of stuff because they made the fatal mistake of not knowing what they were really doing and they were trying to outsmart. They thought they could outsmart the pros on the markets here on this channel. I'm trying to turn you into a much more knowledgeable investor and it takes time and you've got to want to do it. You got to want to hang around a while and watch what a bunch of these folks tell you to talk about. And if you're really serious, I mean if you're dead serious about making money in this market, there's a couple ways to do it. One of the ways to go into it is head over here to this website. It's my website stockmarkerswithbruce.ca. It's not very fancy. It's not very glamorous. It's not very slick. I get emails all the time from these professionals. Would you like to have your website improved upon because it's kind of basic. Here's what it looks like. The homepage. There's my mug. You know it's me. Stockmarkerswithbruce.ca. It's my Canadian website. And you go over there. You head for the classes, the section that says classes. And here we go. Attention students classes are in session. A class in session. And you'll find 16 classes. Lesson number one, number two, how to buy, call and put stock options. Because I'm talking about how to make money in the options market. Even if you're a rookie, you can learn from these classes and you can take one at a time. All the time you like. There's no rush for these. You don't have to take them all in one shot. They're 150 bucks each. And you can take one class a week if you want. One class every two weeks. Start with number four and then go to number eight and then take number one. I would recommend you start with class number one. That's kind of where I talk about. Go to class number one. But here we are. We've done advanced poor man cover call strategies and now we're talking about iron condors here on class 16. Look, I started this channel two and a half years ago. Almost three years. It'll be three years in January that I started going live. I definitely started this channel three years ago when I created it. But in the last two and a half years I have focused on talking about the market in the plainest of English that I can to make most of you understand what the hell is going on. And I put these lessons together so that you can get a leg up on just what is going on in this so-called options market you hear about. You will find if you do Google searches or YouTube searches, you'll find gazillions of channels that talk about stock options. This is nothing, you know, top secret. Okay. You can do a lot of Google searching yourself on options. You can find all kinds of options strategies left, right, center. You'll probably find though most of you kind of gets confusing and kind of gets a little too technical and you start kind of losing it. And this is the biggest problem that people have in the options game is that they want to be involved in the options side to make money. But to learn about it is so complex and is so over the top. And there are some folks on YouTube that love to show off how they can use fancy terms to confuse the hell out of you. Makes no sense. You might as well, you know, people just shut it down. They just give up. At the end of the day, out of all the millions of investors out there who are gambling in the options market, 90% of them are buying options and selling options. They just, they buy a call option and hope it goes up in value and they dump it for a profit. Many of those, majority of them lose money because they don't know the intricacies of the options market. They don't understand the volatility of options and they get their butts handed to them. 10% of all option traders out there, of all of them, of the millions are writers. And that's what I'm talking about here. I'm trying to create option writers for this channel. I want you to be a winner. I want you to be the casino that owns and operates and regulates the slot machines called the options market. I want you to create options that people will buy, that will pay you money upfront to play the option that you're creating. And you're going to buy that contract back for a lovely discount and keep the change in your pocket. There are viewers on this channel here who started two and a half, three years ago, one year ago, one half years ago, with no knowledge of the option market, had no idea what the hell I'm talking about. They stuck around a little while, started taking classes. Then they started hitting me up for one-on-ones, which I also offer. You can always look me up for a one-on-one session. And they spend an hour with me. It's a $400 cost. They pop in. I think there it is right there on my website. Yeah, private consultation is $400. They'll sit down with me for an hour. They'll have a few questions. They just don't quite get it. They've taken my classes, a few of them, three, four, five, six, seven classes, and now they want a one-on-one. They want to start writing options, but they're not quite sure. So we do the one-on-one. I figure out what the issue is for you, figure out what your situation is, and then all of a sudden, the epiphany happens. Oh, that's what I'm doing. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're thinking in reverse is what I'm trying to get you to do. Join the side where all the institutions hang out. I'm trying to get you to do what the hedge funds do, what the mutual funds do, what the banks do, the insurance companies, the pension funds, the mutual funds. All of these gigantic, multi-billion-dollar organizations are option writers. They write because I'm trying to get you to write a few here, a few here, a few here, a few here. You do not need to write a lot of options to become self-employed as an option writer. You can become an option writer and become self-employed in the comfort of your house or apartment or your mom and dad's basement, wherever you're hanging out, in your RV, on the road, or if you're traveling the world like Jen and I, you could be right here in Tel Aviv with one of these and you can write contracts on your account anywhere in the planet, day or night. It doesn't matter anymore. You don't have to call a stockbroker. You do it yourself. You better, however, have an understanding on how it works and that's where I come in. You can watch my classes wherever you are. You've got an internet connection, you can watch my class. Start with number one, move up to number two, three, four, five, and work your way up. The longer you hang out with these folks around here and on our Discord channel, the smarter you're going to get, the more knowledgeable you're going to get, and the more deadly you're going to get in the open market. Now you have to give me one second. I have to just reach forward here and I've got to grab my curtain because the sun has come out in Tel Aviv. We were sitting here a few minutes ago, sunshine and it went away. Now it's back. So I have to put this curtain up so that I don't...\n",
      "So, get too blinded, let me do it that way, there we go. All right, so welcome all of you from around the world who are joining me live from Tel Aviv, Israel. We're here for just a few days. Jen and I are heading out tomorrow and we're finishing our holiday trip. We're gonna end up in New York. We're going to New Jersey, Secaucus, New Jersey, right across the river. October 21 is a meet and greet for Jen and I, my Jennifer Aniston lookalike wife and I. And if you've ever been curious what Auntie Jen looks like, this is your chance to meet her in person. October 21, Secaucus, New Jersey, the Harmony Suites Hotel. If you'd like to come out, it's no cost for you to join us, you gotta send me an email. It would really help us because we're booking our meeting room now and we need to know the exact size of this room. There's various sizes available. So if you send me an email at brucefarmer.hotmail.com, here it is right here, you can do that. Let me know if you'd like to come out for that. October 21 from about one in the afternoon to five in the afternoon is kind of the timing, four hour get together at the Harmony Suites, which used to be the Embassy Suites in Secaucus. Come on out there and join us. Love to see you and you can ask us questions and we'll see if we can help you out with how you're doing. There it is, there's the story. That's what's happening here. Couple of things to let you in on. I did some work this morning. I was kind of curious. First of all, you may notice this logo is up here all the time. This is the gold bagel member logo. You can watch this channel for free. Just click on it. Here I am, hello. But if you wanna make comments over here, you can make comments in the pre-show right now before the market opens up. But once the market starts trading, I ship the comments over to just members only. And you can tell who the members are because you'll note that Double D has a green type for his name and then there's a logo beside him there. Alberto, Bobby, Anatole Lurker. These are members of the channel. If you're a non-member like John Malone right now, he's in black. John is probably busy renewing his membership. I'm sure John will renew his membership in a few minutes, won't you, John? I would be love to have you here. Those are non-members. You can comment on the show until the show, until the market opens up roughly. And then we click over to gold bagel member, to all, to members only. I should correct myself. There are two levels of membership, 10 bucks a month for the chilling with Uncle Bruce level, which means you can comment during my market hours. But if you're a gold bagel member, you're one of these guys right here, you're coughing up 25 bucks a month to YouTube to be a gold bagel member of this channel. Why are these people doing this? What are they, crazy? No, they're not. They're smart. They're joining me because of several things. Every day before I start this show, I do a gold bagel trade alert show just for gold bagel members before this show to give everybody a heads up what's coming up. I also produce the trading tip of the day. I started this a couple of weeks ago, back in September, mid-September. I started bringing out a daily video for gold bagel members only, your trading tip of the day. And I have been zeroing in on these iron condors that we started to cover back in lesson number 16. Started talking about how can you play the market with stocks that you can't possibly afford to buy? There are people here with 10, 20, 30,000 bucks. They don't have enough money to buy a couple of hundred shares of Tesla at 200 something bucks a share. They can't do it. It's almost 50 grand required just to write two measly call contracts. How are you gonna quit your job writing two measly call contracts? You can't do it. You need volume. But with iron condors, you got five or 10 or 20 grand lying around or more. You can write a series of iron condors on Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Google, the triple Qs and the SPY. These are the indexes themselves. Stuff you can't do if you don't have enough cash to do the traditional cover call writing or poor man cover call writing might require too much money from some of you. Anyway, since September 19th or so, this last two weeks plus, every day when I can, because we're on the road, I am producing a trading tip of the day. And we have cranked out a bunch of these iron condor trades that you should take a look at that I've thrown your way. And I gotta tell you, we've done triple Q condor suggestions, Apple on AI, SPY, Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia, Google, every one of these that I've recommended now over the last two odd weeks. If you did these trades, you're making money. The number one objective for me to you is I want you to make $300 a year because that'll cover the cost of this right here. 300 bucks, you got the whole year covered, 25 bucks a month going to YouTube. That's step one. Step two, I want you to make money over and above that. And I want you to make the kind of money where it's possible, where you might start making a thousand bucks a week, going down the road a ways with more confidence and experience. If I can help you make a thousand a week, every week consistently, most of you would likely be in a position to consider saying goodbye to your day job. Now, if you can carry your day job and do these trades at the same time, well, more power to you. You just added another income level into your life. Those of you who have student loans out there, car loans, credit card bills that are just piling up, you're trying to find a way to build your income level to knock off these debts sooner rather than later, Iron Condor income might be for you. Also, those of you who are working your tails off now, 20 years, 25 years, whatever it is, you're trying to build a nest egg that you're going to ultimately try to retire off of, you need to build up capital. You need to build up wealth. And Iron Condor trading and option writing is the way to go. And this is what this channel is all about. There are viewers here who are in their 50s and 60s and older who need a lot of income right freaking now because they can't work anymore. They're limited physically. They're not able to work any longer or their firms want them out, or they've left their firm because they got bought out, whatever the reason, COVID, whatever, they need income on top of the social security or retirement benefits. And they have assets, they just don't know what to do with them because the assets they have are not generating enough revenue to live off of. Maybe what we're doing here is what it's all about. So welcome all to the show. Welcome all to the channel today. Strongly consider becoming a member of this channel, specifically become a GoldBagel member and I'll do everything I can to help you make way more money than what it costs you to be one of these guys. And you'll get quite some nice benefits out of it. Thank you all from Jennifer and I for being here. Without you being members, this channel wouldn't exist. The reason there are members here, simple, they make money. It's that simple. Whatever anyone says, whatever comments you read here, if anyone is making money, not making money, or is happy, is not making money, the end of the day, there are a bunch of people who are members of this channel who make money following what we talk about here and they won't give it up. And without them, I wouldn't be on the air. So the success is because I'm here. As long as I'm on the air, that means people are making money more than losing money. So join the crowd that is making a few bucks out there in the markets. The markets are willing to hand you money like you cannot believe. You cannot believe how ridiculous some of these premiums are that you can get your hands on for triple Qs, SPYs, Google trades, Tesla trades, Apple contracts, AI contracts. You will not believe the kind of premiums. We started writing options here with GameStop. I started talking about people, telling people two years ago, write options on your bloody GameStop stock because some of you were thinking it was gonna go to the moon like the dumb money people. That's okay. While you're waiting, take the money in from all the option gamblers that are just trading GameStop like you can't believe. Same was happening for a whole bunch of other meme stocks. We've moved on from that as well. We've graduated into other areas. And now with Iron Condors, we're here to make a couple of bucks and we're keeping it for ourselves. Thank you very much for all your support. Those of you who are members, thank you. Those of you who are subscribers, thank you very much. Subscribe to this channel right away. Hit the thumbs up button for me. If you can, it should be on the bottom of your screen there. If 61 of you have already done it, nail that thumbs up button. Give us some momentum through YouTube. And again, thank you to all of you who are members. Those of you who are taking the classes.\n",
      "Those of you who have been making donations through Super Chat or through PayPal donations, thank you all very much. You're keeping us in the game and we're live from Tel Aviv because of you. It's as simple as that. How the heck does a guy travel from Canada to Tel Aviv? You don't walk here and you don't swim here. It costs a few dollars, but your success is helping us see the world at the same time and we appreciate it. Thank you all and welcome to the party, pal. We're pretty excited about what's coming up. Lame Duck was a thumbs up number two today. Richard, number three. Robert was in the house. Thanks, pal. Karen D is here, number eight. Mandu is the ninth thumbs up this morning. Appreciate that. Bobby Atkinson from Canada says, good morning, everybody. Rocket Lab is opening up the engine factory they purchased from Virgin this week. I saw an article online about that last night. White Feather is number 14 thumbs up. Amy is number 17. Charlie is here. Uncle Bruce, I forwarded you an email with another Spire announcement. I saw something on Spire this morning. Thanks, Charlie, on this. By the way, No Cell No Cell is here. Wing Commander is here. Yeah, I noticed that Spire made an announcement that NASA awarded a contract to a number of contractors worth almost a half a billion dollars and Spire is in on this contract for their satellite tracking services. There's money coming into Spire's world here. I don't know what this means for the stock on a per share basis, but I can tell you this, 50,000 shares were traded this morning, which is unusual. They were at 485 a share, which is up 44 cents this morning and they were over $5 just a few minutes ago already. Now, to clarify Spire a little bit more, the shares were originally a SPAC and they came out at originally $10 a share, but the stock went down under a dollar this past summer when we had a real rough market for a lot of these SPACs and these guys had to do a rollback for their stock. They did a 10 for one rollback. So if you owned 100 shares, now you own 10 shares. So at 485 a share, your stock is still trading at 48 cents a share compared to the $10 level that came out at, but to also clarify, the stock got down to 28 cents just before the split happened. Now it's from 28 cents to 48, 49, almost at 50. Not saying this is the greatest turnaround in human history, but the stock is going the right direction and if it breaks through 556 bucks, it'll be the highest trading range in over six months. We might be onto a bit of a breakout. I don't know. There are only, by the way, 20 million shares in existence now and 14.4 million are free trading, 281,000 are shorted. So there's only a 2% short on the stock and only 14.4 million can trade. So you're not gonna see 5 million shares trade today, but if you see a couple hundred thousand go through every day, that would be significant and it could move quite substantially. So I'm just telling you, there's some good news out there. Marty, I just wanted to say thanks, Uncle Bruce. I hate your politics. I really hate your politics, but it gives me the opposite side of things. You are the calm voice that keeps me from going crazy as the markets go down. Well, Marty, I thank you and I do the best I can. Marty says that and you taught me how to sell covered calls. A rock and roll comical name here, 24 thumbs up. Good morning. Luca is in the house. Hey, pal. Ciao, my friend. I'm number 35, Bruce Bongiorno. 30 degrees Celsius today. Not too shabby. Uncle Bruce, did you get your meat fix last night? Yes, we got out last night to a deli location and yeah, we pigged out. We rather enjoyed it. Beach Boy is showing us around town here. We're getting a little taste of Tel Aviv. Bobby Atkinson always, what's the spire news? Berlin is here. Spire just announced new NASA contract. That's a big contract. Lame duck. How can Spire stay so low with that contract? Of course, all 476 million doesn't go to Spire. They got a piece of that deal. If you read their press release, a Spire covered call for the win, Marty. Way to go. Alberto in the house, buddy. Welcome back to the gold bagel level and your emoji is current, I'm sure. Good morning, bagel familia. I'm here and we can now begin the day. Yes, sir. We sure can. John Malone is in the house. John, how you doing, pal? We got one guy here is calling himself Dominic saying hello, everybody. Steven Butler, I'm number 51, Bruce, on your thumbs up meter right now. Valerie is here. Good morning, everybody. Hello, Valerie. Bobby watched a video from Spire CEO last night. They have enough satellite orbiting earth. They are in retention mode from now forward. Bobby, all satellites are built in-house from Spire and are reprogrammable. Sounds pretty interesting, actually. Dude, I actually re-watched the classes, I think, often on Saturday, something I missed the first time. It'll now make more sense because of the context I have learned since. The best part about these classes, once you acquire the class for 150 bucks, you can watch it as many times as you want. And if you lose the link, you send me an email, say, Bruce, I can't find the link to number six. I know whether you bought number six or not, and then we'll send you the link, and you're good to go.

      "D, good morning, everybody. Alberto, unbelievable. The uncle just had to explain why you have to pick up his classes and one-on-ones. Financial freedom, folks. I gotta do what I gotta do. Of course, I know that every day I'm on the air, there are those who stumble in here who don't know who the hell I am, and they wonder, why do these people watch this guy? There's nothing fancy about this. He doesn't have fancy graphs, and he doesn't have fancy graphics and neat stuff. Why do they watch this moron? Well, they like making money, and we keep it simple, and that's why I can do this show from wherever I'm located. But hey, join the party, pal. Make some dough. Bobby, sell wave hitting the pre-market. Not a lurker, good morning all. I'm number 54. Dude, I've done very well buying puts and selling them back to this market. Splatter, make another TWB video in New York. Please do that, try it with Bruce's video. I bet it's an instant clickbait if you just name the city. Splatter, Alberto is telling the truth, rock on. Bobby Joe, Spire will pop this morning, awarded ID, IQ, NASA contract, but it's not 476 million to Spire. That's part of the package they're involved with. I don't know what they get out of it, but I like the deal. I like how Spire does deals with the European Space Agency, NASA, and other entities. Lame duck, one hour of Uncle Bruce is still cheaper than one hour with a cheap hooker, and you learn very much more, maybe, laughing out loud. Oh, well, I guess I should say thank you. Splatter, not in Prague. There's everything cheap if you have the dollars. Thanks to Uncle Bruce, Alberto. Splatter, let's get this denaro, baby. Splatter, my plan for next year is to level up to eight or 18 more spreads. Looking already for the 20th per week gig to get faster there before renting second apartment in the Netherlands. Right on, Splatter, it's happening for you. Splatter, so I'm definitely on the way to get more of this denaro. Karen is in the house. Uncle Bruce, I really appreciate your training tips of the day. I can see what I did wrong in the past. Charlie, yes, definitely bring more income in so that you can pay those student loans. We need to increase SoFi earnings. Dude, I've been selling junk in my house, putting more money in the market. Get those spreads going. Splatter, SoFi is on a good way, even with some famous YouTube channels for younger ones that are paid for them. Trader Timmy, oh, a nice nod to us, subscribers and thumbs ups, folks. Cheers. Marcus, number 57, thumbs up here. Good morning, go aspire. It's up 23% pre-market, hit 543, though. It gave up some gain since then. Splatter, dude, interesting idea. We still have some stuff I never used in the basement, but it feels like, anyways, 12 hours are not enough. Splatter says, too much free time. Appreciate it, I think I might go. All right, SR215, I don't know what eight to one means. DH, Splatter did an eight for one, aspire? Eight for one rollback. All right, dude, go to Rummage Sales on the weekends. Maybe you can find something to resell. Beach Boy, Alberto, is that you? Beach Boy, for real, primo? SR, the contract will be effective for five years with the opportunity to complete for task orders under a $417 million shared ceiling amongst all contractors selected. Maria, number 76, thumbs up, Bruce, and good morning, everybody. Initial XE, number 10, I don't know. Charlie, I've only done two one-on-one classes with Uncle Bruce. I can count those sessions. I can't count how many times over those sessions have paid for themselves, though. Dude Face, number 77, Beach Boy, Israel, Supreme Court can declare the show legal since Alberto is here. We're good to go, right on, buddy. Rock and roll, we're here, and we're trying to make it work. Well, what can I say, aspire at the moment, looks like it's around 490, so it's up 49 cents at the moment, it did break the five level for a bit. We'll see what happens. The US trade deficit is at nearly a three year low, so that's good news.\n",
      "there. The European markets are mixed. We're up half a point in London, break even right now in Germany. We're up just a bit in France on the futures market with 20 minutes to go before we trade. We're negative in the U.S. Maybe this trade deficit number wasn't so great. I don't know. Jobless claims inch up to USD$207,000, but no sign of rising U.S. layoffs. The U.S. trade deficit shrinks 10% to $58 billion at nearly a three-year low. Anyway, the jobs data caused the markets to drop. We're down 77 on the Dow, 10 on S&P, 24 on NASDAQ. Crude oil down 90 cents a barrel to 83.34. Oil has lost $11 in less than two weeks, maybe $10 in like a week. We've really backed off from that 94 level. There was talk, talk, talk. That oil was going right to 100, 110. Now we're at 83.43. Very interesting to see how that is playing itself out. Interest rates are 472.9 for the 10-year U.S. note. It's backed off from the 4.85 yesterday to 4.72. So we'll watch that. There are still calls for the 10-year to go over 5%. Euro against the U.S. dollar, 105.18. The pound, 121.34. They're hanging in there, but still at the low end of their three-month trading range for sure. Back to the watch list on some of our favourites. Rocket Lab seems to be up about 3 cents right now at $4.34. It was up 14 cents yesterday. SoFi gained 19 cents yesterday to $7.47. Right now $7.44. GameStop was up 27 cents yesterday. After all that turmoil, we were down to $14.45, closed at $14.87. Right now $14.79, down $8. Matterport, $2.17 last night, up $7. It's at $2.14 right now. 23andMe trading at 89.6 cents, up about 2 cents. Spire, as I said earlier, up $49 at $4.90. It was up 18 cents yesterday. ATIP, $8.69 last night, $8.56 this morning. Smart ran $2.66 yesterday, $2.59 this morning. Apple shares gained $1.26 yesterday, down $0.50 right now. We were positive about an hour ago. Goldman was up $2.48 yesterday. We're down $0.61. Cisco was down $0.20. We're down $0.07 now. Tesla was up $14.63 yesterday, down $1.37 this morning. ARK Innovations was up $0.56. We're down $0.18 right now. Microsoft was ahead yesterday, $5.56. We're down $0.47. Pfizer down $0.59 yesterday, down just $0.02 this morning. HPQ down $0.09 yesterday. We're down $0.02 right now, $0.2602. Google was up $2.97 yesterday. It's down $0.54. Amazon was up $2.27. It's down $0.16. NVIDIA was up $5.24 yesterday. It's up $0.47 this morning. Unity down $0.12. It's down $0.08 now. AI was up $0.14. It's down $0.24 at the moment. Adobe was up $11.39 yesterday. It's up $1.57 more right now. $5.19.99 a share on Adobe. Netflix was up $0.15 yesterday. It's up $0.17 more now. Spiders are down $1, and triple Qs are down $0.62 at the moment. As we work our way 16, 14 minutes away, 16 minutes away from the opening roughly, and we'll get this party started. See what's going on. Thank you all for joining us today from wherever you are in the world. We appreciate you being here. We're showing some thumbs ups that have come through. I don't know quite where we are on the thumbs up meter. I think we're at 81 now. I appreciate that. Keep those thumbs ups coming in. We're going for 100 before the market opens up every day, and hopefully we can get closer to 200 by the time the show is done. Thank you, one and all, from me to you, all of you who are subscribers, members, you name it. We love you, and we appreciate you all being with us. We're going to go members only now for a chat. Thank you again, all of you. Please become a member if you can, and grow this channel. We'll keep the recommendations coming. We'll give you a trade recommendation every morning. Hopefully that'll make you more than enough to cover the $25 a month fee for that. I'm sure it will. As a matter of fact, I don't know how you can't make $25 a month. I don't know how you can't. I just don't know. I mean, just doing a single condor, you'll probably make a couple of hundred bucks every month. Just, oh God, you'll make more than that. I'm certain of it. But yeah, I mean, if you can get yourself into the 10 condor level at a time, you know, you got 10, 15, 20 grand. You can easily do 10 condors at a time. If you can do 10 condors, maybe two a week on the go here, you're making thousands of dollars a month without, I don't think, any question about it. I think you'd make thousands of dollars a month. But you got to step up to it and you really need to understand how options work. You have to understand how options are created, how options, why they trade higher and lower. You have to understand how they expire. You have to understand the difference between put contracts and call contracts. You've got to understand premiums. You have to understand the volatility of the contracts. And the classes that I've recommended, I've put together, covers all of this. It is, it's a step-by-step way of learning and becoming comfortable with the lingo we use here all the time on how options trading actually works. And without the knowledge, you are at the mercy of professional traders who will tear you apart. You cannot come into this option market cold and without any info whatsoever. You're just asking for it. But if you come in here with some knowledge on how options work and react and how to write them and why you'd write them, you'll then figure out, oh, this is what he's talking about. This is what everyone's all excited about over here all the time. This is why there are so many members of this guy's channel versus his views, his viewers. Almost all of his viewers are members. You figure out very quickly, oh, this is why Alberto and Beach Boy are talking about what they're saying, why they say what they say. Same with Aurora and same with Larry Titus and Gregory and all the others who are here. I get it now. It makes sense. But I'm telling you, of all of you who are out there who are not involved in this channel and somehow stumble across this old man, I can tell you right now, you could meet Beach Boy or Dude or Alberto or any of these other members. You could go for a coffee with these guys and sit down at a Starbucks or wherever and have a latte. And they would try to tell you how they do what they do. But if you haven't taken the classes and you haven't been here for a while, your eyes will glaze over in about a minute. You'll be lost. You'll just go, I don't know what they're talking about. I don't understand it. You understand some of it, but you don't get the rest of it. This is a common thing for all of the viewers of this channel. The viewers of this channel have all tried. I'm telling you without a word of a lie, every single one of these guys, guys and girls have tried to tell their best friends, their co-workers, their trusted pals, their relatives, their mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their cousins, their uncles, their aunts, boyfriends and girlfriends and former boyfriends and girlfriends and ex-wives and ex-husbands and kids. Every one of these folks has had a scenario where they have tried to tell someone else that they know should be doing this. They should be writing options because their accounts are in such a mess. Their finances are in such disarray. They've had nothing but losses in the markets for years and they desperately need to bring income into their accounts and grow their accounts. They have tried time and time again to try to explain to these folks as best they can what's going on with option writing and they've all failed. Maybe one or two are successful, I don't know. But I can tell you time and time again, I get told in person through one-on-ones, these one-on-one sessions we have, I get told with private emails all the time and then right here on this chat box, they tell me again and again. I tried to tell my best friend about this at work. He's got a hundred grand sitting in his 401k and he's just getting annihilated with these stupid tips he keeps going after. I tried to tell the guy\n",
      "Look, you should write options. Watch Uncle Bruce for a while. Take a couple of his classes. I'm telling you, it's gonna change your life to no avail. It is what it is, great. Gregory, I think I'm number 78. Lorraine, I think I'm number 84 on the thumbs up meter. Flint Creek, no one loves a stock tip, no one. Dude, I've glazed so many eyes. Some of them listen in rapture, but at the best, they have analysis paralysis. I have viewers of this channel who are absolutely excellent at communication. They're really good at it. They, at work, in their careers, they can explain some of the most complex situations in their offices or at the factories they worked in or the companies and what have you. They're very good at what they do, but they're God awful when they try to tell people how to be an option writer. They just can't do it. It's rather tricky. I've got 16 classes already out there on my website. Class 17, 18, 19, 20, they're coming. The next year, I'll be up to 20 classes. I am still edumacating the group here. The folks that are watching me now who are members here, who have been members for two years, I'm still bringing them up to speed on more and more and more of the intricacies of option writing. But where we are now, where we've been for the last year, a whole bunch of folks here have had a pretty good time of it and have brought in some serious dough. A number of folks here have quit their day jobs. They've said goodbye to their jobs a long time ago. There are a number of viewers here who travel now more than their home. And there are a number of viewers here who have found a way to add value and asset value to their retirement accounts. So they know that they have a hope in hell of retiring in some decent comfort and not relying on social security to make it go. Because if you are counting on social security to cover all your bills and all your medical needs and everything else, you're dreaming. You're in technicolor because you're not paying attention to what's happening in Congress. The clown show over there wants to eliminate most of what you're gonna get when you retire. These folks know they don't have the money to pay you and they wanna stop it now. They wanna change the rules now. They wanna raise the retirement age on you. They wanna change Medicare. They wanna make it almost impossible for you to have a life. You better take care of yourselves. Don't be counting on the government of your country to carry you, especially if you want a middle-class lifestyle, you can forget about that. You're not getting a middle-class lifestyle from any government pension. Wake up and smell the coffee. How many horror stories are you reading right now? Those of you who are just renters out there, have you read the horror stories of some of the rents that people are facing right now in various cities around the world? It's insane. The cost of groceries and everything else, it's nuts. You better have a nest egg and get going. We'll see what's going on. The wall's going back up, says Lorraine. I did get one guy to buy sofa after I told him I had 1,450 shares. There you go, Aurora. The classes are great. I need to catch up with the last couple of them. One class will be my Christmas present to myself. Flint Creek, my dad has actually followed my shares and shared tips. I think he isn't listening and then, bam, he has 1,000 shares of SoFi. I mean, wow, Octavio. Thank you, member for 28 months. I was number 71, Uncle Bruce, on the thumbs up meter. I'm still thankful for you sharing your knowledge with us. Right on, thank you, Octavio. Constantine, good morning, everybody. I am thumbs up number 90. Bruce, you are going for 100 thumbs ups here. Robert Benson, I'm number 92. You're getting 100 thumbs ups. It's happening and it's going beyond. You guys are awesome. We see 94 now that are sitting here. 94 thumbs ups, they're coming in. Thank you all for joining the thumbs up party and thank you to Octavio for these. I love these mentions. Aurora, same thing, 27 months. A member of this channel. Octavio, chilling with Uncle Bruce. Aurora, gold bagel member, 27 months. Thank you, guys. It means a lot to me when you do these. All of you out there are able to do these postings. There's no charge to post these out there. Thank you all very much for letting the world know how long you've been a member of this channel. There's only one reason they're here. It's not for their health. It's for their financial health is why they are members of this channel. Thank you. Maria, I closed on half of my Tesla cash secured puts yesterday for an 80% profit. I cut the other half at 50%. Let's go. Right on. Dude, that's something people can understand. Buy and hold, wait for the moon. Alberto, nice work. Maria, thank you, Alberto. Thank you very much. I love it when we get these kinds of notices. Folks out there who've written calls, they've written puts, they've done condors, cash secured puts, you name it. I'm excited for you guys. God, I love it when you guys are making money in this market. This market is not easy to make money in right now. Look at the Dow right now. We're down 109. We're not going up and people are making money around here. We're down 16 on S&P. We're down 46 on NASDAQ. Oil down 130 a barrel, $1.30 a barrel. We're down to 82.90 now on oil from 94, what, two weeks ago? Barely, and this is serious stuff. This is good news. Dr. Salamanca, number 94. He says, thank you, my friend, White Feather. I came to the bagels in Yoko Ono. I stayed for the money. I love it. Glad you're all here. My Yoko Ono album is in storage in Calgary right now. We are thousands of miles away from that Yoko Ono album. So it'll be a while before we crank that baby up. Karen is in the house. Karen, Bruce, I've been a member for 13 months, but I've been lurking from the beginning. Gold bagel member of this channel. Thank you, Karen, so much for being a gold bagel level member. 13 months and counting, getting smarter every day, every week, every month. It's beautiful. We have 96 thumbs ups in the meter right now, the thumbs up meter. Four more, we get the triple digits. Keep them coming in, kids. We're three minutes away from the opening. Well, we might make it 100 thumbs up by the opening. We need one or two a minute now to make it to 100. If you guys can find that thumbs up button, hit that sucker and get us over 100 thumbs ups before the markets even start trading. We love it. Thank you. It is all good stuff. All right, Alberto White Feather, ditto, says Alberto. I came for the bagels, but I stayed for the money. Yeah, baby. Charlie C, personally, I am thankful that you're thousands of miles from the Yoko Ono album. I fear it might not be far enough. Dude, okay, markets do your thing. Alberto, we're getting ready for some fun here. WhoCare says, I am number 99, Bruce, on your thumbs up meter. I see a manager at number 101, and I think we're at 102 now. Thank you guys for helping us just do it. It just happens. Thank you guys. 103 now are in here. 103 thumbs ups, and we're climbing. Thank you all, and away we go. Triple digits on the thumbs up meter, and we're waiting for our friend, Mr. Larry Titus, to hit the official bell emojis. He's gonna do those any moment, and thank you, Larry, for your service to this channel. We love ya, and we're getting ready to start this party up, and let's see what it's all about today. What kind of money can be made by the viewers of this channel in this ridiculous market? We've got the House of Representatives in complete turmoil. The US government, totally dysfunctional. We have a war in Europe going on. We have high interest rates. We have high inflation. We have oil going stupid, and yet the viewers of this channel are making money in this market. Are all the other channels on YouTube in the market making money? Is everyone out there making money? I don't think so. I bet you they aren't. I think that there are some that are making money, but not all of them. I don't think so. Dude, I'm riding these banks to the bottom buying puts, selling call credits, spreads. Larry Titus, bingo, bang, bang, bang. The lights are, the bells are ringing right now. We are up and running. We're rocking and rolling. Thank you. Thank you, Larry. Again, for letting us know that the markets are indeed open for business. We're here for business. Let's see if we can make some money today, and hopefully you kids just get a whole bunch richer. That's what it's all about.\n",
      "It's nothing personal. It's just business. You know, as they say in the Godfather, it's not personal. We're just here to make the dough. By the way, those of you curious, we have some dates for you to keep in mind. Earnings coming up. SoFi, October the 30th, will be releasing their financials. GameStop all the way out to December the 7th, apparently, before we hear from GameStop. But we're going to hear from Matterport on November the 9th, Rocket Lab, November the 8th, ME23andMe on November 6th, Spire, we're just talking about Spire here. We're going to hear from them on November 7th, how they're doing. ATIP, November 14, SmartRent, November 9, Sextera Reports, November 12th, if any of you have any of that left. And AI, the C3AI.com stock, November 28th. Those are the release dates for the next financials coming up on a bunch of these guys. We'll follow, of course, everybody else. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, we'll follow them all. But there you go. We got word coming out. We have news and financials coming out. 106 thumbs up. Thank you. I'm hopeful that the SoFi shares will take a nice little shot between now and October 30, which is 15 days away, Monday. Hoping that'll happen. There's a bulletin here. Americans are increasingly working into their 70s for a variety of reasons. How do you like that headline? Do you guys want to be working into your 70s? Now, I'm 68 and I'm doing this because I love it. I love doing this. This is great. You guys are making a bunch of dough. We're running some dough from the success of this channel because of your success. And so Jen and I are traveling like we've never thought we would be able to travel. So we're thrilled. Who cares? I had some $10 SoFi cover calls written for January 2024. Do you think I should buy back before? Yeah, I think you should. I would definitely do that. I don't think you want to be holding $10 calls. White Feather, have a great day, everybody. Alberto, be well, my friend. Oh, indeed. Thank you, White Feather. We're down 9 on the Dow at the moment. I think that's what we're showing right now, down 9 points. And now I think we're actually green on the Dow, up 1.6 higher. So we've had a turnaround from pre-market to here. S&P is down just a point. And NASDAQ down 12. Oil down $1.12, though. See what's going on there. That jobless report did not hurt the market very long. We're now plus 10 on the Dow. So the markets are coming up right now. Alberto, White Feather, back at you. Fill them pockets with money. Rock and roll. JR, thanks for the bells, Lair. Says JR. Right on, JR. Welcome to the show, buddy. Nice to have you here. We're looking at looking at Enphase, actually, E-N-P-H. Enphase down a nickel at $117.13. That moved up a little bit yesterday. We've got Q's down $0.14. SPY is down $0.07. We have GameStop down $0.22. Telepoint down $0.04, but Apple's up $0.38. Netflix down $1.32. Adobe up $1.98. AI down $0.20. NVIDIA's up almost $3. $2.99. Tesla's up $0.57. We've got Matterport down a penny here. Rocket Lab up a penny. SmartRent up a dime. ATIP down $0.02. Unity down $0.31. Google is down $0.36. Moderna down $0.14. Cisco down a nickel. Pfizer's up $0.04. No, Pfizer's up $0.40. IBM down $0.14. HBQ down a nickel. Microsoft down $1.07. ME down $0.01. Amazon is off $0.88. Spire right here at $4.75, up $0.34 at the moment. $32,000 traded. Multiply that by eight to get the pre-split. That's a half a million shares traded with an eight to one rollback. $4.75, the high of $4.83, the low of $4.75. Market cap on Spire, the whole company, is $99M. They just got a contract with NASA for five years. The value of the whole contract with a whole bunch of contractors, $470M. They got their sliver of that action. This whole company is $99M. Spire is about to become profitable in the next quarter or two or three. They're about to go to the plus side and be making money. $4.75 a share. This is ridiculous. I don't make the rules. I just quote the quotes. I can't help you there. There it is. All right. Thank you, everybody. What else going on here? Good morning, says JR. I'm number 106, a farmerless. My old man is 82. Still works for the government with a contractor just because he likes having people to interact with. And that is a rarity. And God bless him for it. But it is an absolute rarity out there. There are folks out there in their 50s who can't work anymore. Health reasons. Folks in their 60s and 70s, they just cannot do it. And they have to have investment returns to make it. And if you are living on Social Security and Medicare, you're not doing the high life. And there are a lot of folks out there who are used to a middle class, upper middle class lifestyle. They've got to build their investments to keep that going in retirement. Join us here and it might be the answer you're looking for. JR, okay, Uncle Bruce, I'm going to take a chance and ask the stupid question I know everyone else has been dying to ask. Get my wet noodle ready for the 100 lashes. Get ready, drink up on the Diet Coke and turn into the, and I'm waiting to see what his question has to say. Thank you all for joining us. Let's see what we got going on here. Aspire, 473, holding a 32 cent gain. I'm going to make an adjustment on my phone here. I've got to edit Aspire on my watch list because it looks like we're going to be watching this one all day long here, the way this thing is going. The Dow is a 0.3 of a point higher. And we've got triple Qs and spiders are up 5, 10 cents each. GameStop is down 29. SoFi is down just four. I think SoFi is about to go. I really do. I think SoFi will get through its first 15, 20 minutes. And I think in the next week, 10 days, SoFi is going back to 9, 9.50, 10 bucks. You've written any calls on SoFi, you cover your ass right now because this thing I think is about to go. I'm just saying, I'm just saying, 7.46 down a penny. Apple up 35, Netflix down 24, Adobe up 158, AI down 3 cents. I think the low has been hit on AI. Nvidia up 4 bucks. OK, JR, JR, JR. All right. So I turn into Kribble Hulk. I'll take the tongue lashing for all. Am I supposed to be rolling my GameStop deep in the money calls up and down with the market? I don't think so, JR. If you're sitting on, if you're sitting on tens, you know, deep in the money, $10 GameStop, I would look, I would do this. I would take a look at, like you're probably into January 25. I would look into January 26. Always keep an eye on those. If you could move from $10 deep in the money calls for 2025 into 2026 for very little money, then great. Then anytime you want. But there's no rush. I mean, this is October 2023. So, you know, you have months to figure this out. But if you're sitting on 12s or 15s or 18s, well then, yeah, you may want to go back into 15s or 12s. Again, though, 2025 into 2026 and beyond if you can. All right. I've got five deep in the money, $13 strikes. January 2025. You don't have to right now. You don't have to right now. Even at 1468, you don't have to do anything right now. Keep writing. Just keep on writing. They're down by $4,650. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Keep writing on these contracts and bring in that $4,650. Bring in as much of that as you can every time you write more contracts. That's the whole point of it. And if you can buy new contracts right now, can you buy tens for 2025 or 2026? Can you get tens to add more and then write more calls because of the calls you're writing on these? Do it. Just keep doing it. Just keep writing. Buy tens. Buy eights. Buy sevens. Buy sixes. Buy five. Whatever you can. And keep writing. Keep adding and keep writing. Keep adding. Keep writing. You'll average it all down. You'll average it all out and you'll increase your revenues. Don't be writing $25 calls. Don't be writing 20s. Write 16s. Write 17s. Write 1750s. Write 18s. Write till January of 2024. Write out till…\n",
      "March 2024, bring in money right now. That's what the stock owes you, bring it in. Lame duck, what's the chances of getting exercised? What do you care? So what? You write a 1750 and you get exercised? So what? It doesn't matter if you get a buck and a half for it and then you get 1750 just sold for $19, buy the stock back or buy the contracts back and write more. Don't worry about being exercised, dare them. Dare them to take you out. Dare them, there's no problem here. No, absolutely, be writing at all times. Absolutely be writing. Spire, it's 468, still up 27 cents. Lame duck, I got 16 deep in the monies started. You better be writing on those. I want you writing on those. Have you folks figured out how much money you've taken in from your deep in the money call options that you've been sitting on, that you've been writing against? Have you factored that out? I know some of you have got $9 averages, 10, 12, some have 13, $14 averages. You've been writing, you've been writing, you've been writing, you've been writing, you've been writing, how much money have you taken in on all those deep in the money contracts? Months, eight months, a year, year and a half? Some of you might be shocked at how much money you've been paid to write contracts on your GameStop. Some of you, I bet you are ahead on the whole deal, that you've made more money on your GameStop than the depreciation of the stock, because you've written all the time. Keep writing, just keep writing, take money off the table. 1472 to 15 cents, so far down a dime right now. Q's are down 94, SPY's down 65, Enphase down 250 at the moment, Aspire's up 28 cents, Dow's down 50. We got a little sell wave going through on the Dow, we're down 11 on S&P, 38 on NASDAQ, but then again, we had a down day, down wave yesterday, right until what, two o'clock? And then the turnaround happened, 200 point turnaround, from two o'clock in the afternoon yesterday until the close, the Dow went up over 200 points, had a 100 and something point gain. We may have exactly the same thing going here. These sell-offs look to me like they're running out of gas. The sell-offs are tiring out, and we may have ourselves a bit of a pop here, just when people thought, oh, the markets are going down, all of a sudden there's a pop higher, everybody missed it because they weren't speculating rather than investing. Be a writer. Lame duck, better to buy deep in the money SOFI or buy the stock, buy the stock, buy the stock, buy the stock, buy the stock, buy the stock, buy the stock, it never expires, buy SOFI shares. When it hits 15, 16, 18, you're going to thank me so much. You're going to do very well with your stock, you're going to haul in dollars and dollars and dollars per share, and you're going to get rich. Simple as that. There are folks here who have three, eight, 10, 20, 30, 60, 100 plus thousand shares. At 20, 25 a share, you're going to be happy. Some of you are going to be upset because you don't have enough. I understand that, it's okay. 732, pick it up, grab this stuff. Let's go, baby. Cash secured puts, write 10s, write $10 cash secured puts for January or March into next year. Dare the market to not go up. Watch it go. You're going to make money, you're going to make money. Going to be fun. It's going to be so much fun. Gosh, I'm excited. Spire, 465, up 24.7 cents this morning. The Dow down 59 points. Welcome to the party, pal. Great to have you here. Let's see how it\n",

      "works out. We've got 111 thumbs ups. Thank you guys. 111, appreciate that. Triple digits, ones across the board. Keep them coming, baby. Keep them coming in. Lame duck. I got 2,100 shares now, but thought I might help to pick up some extra. Yeah, just keep picking them off, picking them off, picking them up. Absolutely pick them up. Indeed, indeed you can. Right down here, you want to scoop them up. We are, what do we want? 15 days away. Two weeks and a day away from the financial report for the latest quarter. I don't think they've lost any members. I think they're another half a million to a million members. I think their deposits are higher yet again. I bet you they're ranked higher on that biggest banks in America. They're well into probably the 90s or 80s by now. They're climbing that ladder dramatically. Their sales are up. Their revenues are up. They're about to go profitable if they aren't profitable already. 732 a share. I don't know. I don't know what else to tell you. It's as good as it gets. Hector, Uncle Bruce, if the sell-offs are running out of gas, then another few days of patience could reward me by not having to roll quickly. Again, if, if, if. You're using that word. Forget that word. Just write. Take money and deal with the upside. The problems you guys need are rollover problems. These are problems you want to have. You've written 1750 game stops and the stock went to $20. Oh, boo hoo. This is exactly what you want to have happen. These are problems you guys need up to your necks right now. Write. Take the money off the table. People are handing it to you. Grab this money. You have other uses for it, whether it's to buy more stock, deepen the money calls, move into something else like SoFi. I don't know. Get in there and make those option gamblers be the gamblers. Don't be the gambler. Don't be sitting back going, oh, I'll let it go up a little bit before I write. No, no, right now. Be writing. Don't write SoFi 10s. Write SoFi $10 cash secured puts. Or nines, or eights, or twelves. But be writing and bring in some dough here. Bring in some serious dough. It's time to be paid for this. 465 on Spire. Go Spire, go. All right, there it is. We're doing the best we can. We don't waver. We stay the course. And we keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling. Hector, Uncle Bruce rolling up at the market bottom seems like I have no patience. It's the hardest thing to learn in this market. Cross your arms and let the market come your direction when it's not. 71 point loss on the Dow, hardly a problem. Hardly a big issue to deal with here. S&P down 11, NASDAQ down 36, a quarter of a percentage point. Whoop-dee-doo. This market doesn't want to go down. That's what this is telling me. This market does not want to go lower. Actually wants to go higher. Just waiting it out. We're 17 minutes into the day. Where's the 5% drop? Where's the 3% drop? Where's the 2% drop? Where's the panic? Where's the panic selling? There isn't any. There's no panic selling here. Get ready, kids. Get ready. Anyway, we're down just a dime on GameStop, 1477. Down 13 on SoFi. That's where we're at right now. 23 cent gain on Spire. One times, we have 112 thumbs ups. We've been able to get one more thumbs ups out of you guys. Thank you, everybody. Helping us out, I appreciate it. See what we get going here. There's so much money to be made in this market. Oh my goodness, you guys. You guys are on the precipice of greatness. And you gotta believe it. You gotta believe in yourself, but you gotta have the knowledge. Get those classes under your belt while it's quiet. Absolutely. What's going on here? JR. Okay, I stepped away from some coffee. Did he turn green yet? Did we get the wet noodle up? Deep value, Citadel's the only one panic selling dumb money firmless. This reminds me of an episode of Celebrity Jeopardy. Uncle Bruce says buy and Kino Reeves says sell for 600. Splare, Carvana at the low was down 5% today. There you go. 62 point dip on the down. That's all. A fifth of a percentage point. There's no selling here. This is chump change. This is nickels and dimes. That's all we're looking at. Down 11 on S&P, down 42 on NASDAQ. This is nothing, nothing burger. Absolute nothing burger on the activity side. 1481 on SoFi, 1482 on SoFi. Down six. Coming back. SoFi, sorry, GameStop. 1482 coming up. SoFi down 12 at 735. Go SoFi, go. There you have it. Should be fun coming up. A lot of fun coming up. The earnings are coming between October 30 and December 7. Look out, kids. That is closer than you can imagine. There you go. All right. We got a lot to watch, a lot to follow. Apple's still up 25 cents on the day. Pfizer's up 34. We got NVIDIA up 255. Those are the winners on the quotes that I'm watching here with you guys. They're definitely winners. And Spire, of course, up 23 today. It's up 23 cents so far. I think there's more upside to coming on a lot of this stuff. Giddy up, kids. Low of the day on SoFi was 730. We're now 739. Down just nine cents.\n",
      "And we've got GameStop at $14.78, just down $9.00. Triple Q is down $1.44. Spiders are down $0.82. The Dow is only down 38 points now. Coming on again, 0.13 of a percentage point loss on the Dow, absolutely nothing. Oil down $101, $83.21. That's good for inflation. Lower price of oil, lower gas, lower diesel, lower everything, lower cost to move products, cheaper, lower inflation. That takes an inflation pressure point away. Brian, number 112. Good morning, everybody. Splatter, go GameStop. I want to be, I want to write a $19 call for a gain against my $20 spread call. I read something and watched something earlier today that just infuriates me, and it frustrates me to no end. And one of the things that frustrates me is how few people in North America get it. In Canada and in the United States, the North American partners that we are, I saw a story today, it was out a couple of days ago, so this is, some of you might know about it, some of you might not. It had to do with Volkswagen, VW. The story was about Volkswagen, and the story started off by saying that their sales in China are backing off. VW in China is getting its butt handed to it. And the reason, one of the big reasons is that China has gone heavily into EVs. The government of China is encouraging its citizens to go to electric vehicles. They want to get gas vehicles off the road. They want to improve air quality and so on. The Chinese have the raw materials to make batteries. They want to be a leader in EV production. And so, you know, that's what's happening. Well, Volkswagen is trying to go EV, they're trying to go electric, but they're behind the eight ball, just like everybody else except Tesla. They're all behind the curve. And so they're putting in billions of dollars to upgrade and convert their plants to produce electric vehicles. Okay, fair enough. Now, what they talked about, and this is the area where North Americans, we just don't know, we just don't know what's going on. We're ignorant to this. I told you folks a couple of weeks ago, maybe, you know, three, four weeks ago, I talked to you guys about the chicken tax. The chicken tax that was imposed in 1964, 65 by President Johnson, okay, a Democrat, way back when he imposed the chicken tax. And the reason it's called the chicken tax was the European Union at the time, European countries, they imposed a 25% tax on U.S. poultry exports into Europe because the Americans were dumping chickens into Germany, West Germany in particular, and into France and into Belgium and the Netherlands and Spain and Italy. The American farmers, good old American farmers were producing a gazillion chickens. They had way more than they needed for the U.S. market. So they started to dump chickens into Europe. And European farmers were going, hey, we're getting crushed here. We cannot produce chickens for the low, low price that the Americans are just dumping chickens into our markets. And we're going to get knocked out. We're going to get blown out of here. We're going to be out of business. And then Europe will be at the beck and call of the American farmer because we won't have any domestic flocks here. So the Europeans imposed a chicken tax, which is what they called it, 25% on American chickens. Did this destroy American farmers? No. Did it alter the world powers? No. But what did it do? It encouraged American businesses that are experts at finding ways to trick the U.S. government into giving them subsidies under whatever scheme they want to come up with. American businesses are diabolical when it comes to finding ways to scare the U.S. government into giving them money. And one way to scare the U.S. government to giving them money was to find a way, and this is what the auto guys did, the guys in the automobile business, all the lobbyists in Washington, which there are gazillions, they came to the White House and to Congress and to the senators and they said, hey, those gosh darn to heck Europeans that we just sent our boys over to save from the communists and the Nazis, look what those buggers are doing to our American boys here, our farmers in Texas and Louisiana and Georgia and Carolinas and Michigan, oh, and those Ohio farmers, they're getting their butts handed to them by those gosh darn to heck Europeans who are ungrateful for all the Second World War things we did for them. You know what we ought to do, why don't you put a tariff on light trucks coming in from Germany, because those guys at Volkswagen in West Germany, they're screwing the American car manufacturers, the Ford F-150, the Dodge pickups and the Chevy trucks and GMC trucks. Those Germans, they figured out a way to get these light trucks of theirs over here in the United States. They're going to cost us a bunch of American automobile jobs. They're going to put a tariff on chickens from freedom-loving American farmers. We should put a tariff on their light trucks and teach them a lesson they'll never forget. The Johnson administration put a 25% tax tariff on all light trucks coming into America from anywhere, anywhere except Canada, because we have that auto pact. That tariff is still here to this very day. 48 years later, the chicken tax is still going to this very day. It was never repealed by any administration after Johnson left office. It was permanent. The chicken tax is over. The actual chicken tax, that died a few months later, very quietly. The Europeans said, okay, we're okay now, everything's fine. But nobody reversed the light truck tax, the chicken tax on light trucks. American consumers and Canadian consumers have been ripped off by their very own car manufacturers for 48 years, and it's still going on. The F-150 pickup truck, the Dodge Ram, the GMC pickup, I don't care which one you talk about. I don't care if you talk about the quarter ton, the half ton, the one ton. All those SUVs out there that are built in America, they're all considered quasi light trucks, but certainly the pickup trucks. American consumers have been ripped off by their domestic car companies with the help of their US government, freedom loving government they have, to the tune of billions of dollars every year since 1965. And the reason I mention it again today, because I've mentioned it before, I'll mention it again today, VW, Volkswagen, has decided we are going to build EV vehicles in the United States and in Canada. And we're going to build the brand new version of the bus, the VW bus, the most popular vehicle amongst college kids in America for decades. You remember Woodstock in 1969? Do you remember that? If you ever see any images of Woodstock 69, or if you see any other outdoor music festivals through the decades, you see Lovin's in 1967 in San Francisco, you see all the college kids traveling through the 80s, you see all the images of college kids protesting the Vietnam War. These college kids are now grandparents, okay? One of the favorite vehicles that they drove like crazy was not only the VW Bug, but it was the Volkswagen camper bus. And that was the vehicle that Detroit went after to ban it into the US if it was going to come in as a light truck. As long as it had seats in it, it was considered a passenger vehicle. But if the Germans were going to try to bring in pickup trucks, or the Brazilians, or the Venezuelans, or the Italians, or the French, or the Brits, $25,000.\n",
      "25% tariff on trucks. If Toyota or Nissan or Hyundai or Mercedes-Benz or Audi or anybody else was trying to bring in a pickup truck that looked like an F-150 pickup truck with all the bells and whistles that Ford had, with all the performance that Ford had, 25% duty would be added to the price of the vehicle coming in, which meant that Ford, GM and Chrysler, they could produce these basic 1950s technology vehicles for decades and decades, flog them to unsuspecting American consumers and Canadian consumers for a retail price that would make these automakers nothing but money. Every single truck that GM sells today and Ford and everyone else has $20,000-$30,000 of profit in every one of them. If Toyota were allowed to build a truck in Japan that equalled an F-150, like the Tundra, like the big one they produce now, they could produce it in Japan for those decades, the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, the 2000s, the 2010 years. All those manufacturers in Japan and Korea and elsewhere, they could have brought in vehicles like the pickup truck. North America would be sitting on pickup trucks that would be half as expensive as they are now. But oh no, you will pay what they want you to pay. Now back to VW, they're building plants. They're going to create the Volkswagen bus. But here's the saddest part about the story. One of the sad parts. There are two versions of the Volkswagen bus that are going to be created. The one version is for the North American market being built in North America. The other one is going to be built for the European market for the Europeans. The European Volkswagen bus will be shorter, lighter and smaller. The American version for North America will be longer and heavier with one more row of seats. Because we in Canada and in America are big fat slobs that want all the elbow room and we want all the room inside our vehicles. We want all the bells and whistles. We don't give a crap about performance. But they're all electric. These are going to be all electric EV vehicles. And we're going to buy them like you can't believe. And Volkswagen is bringing out SUVs and everything else. Electric, electric, electric. There's a huge battery plant being built in Canada right now for VW. $5 billion be being spent by VW and $10 billion by the government of Canada and the government of Ontario in subsidies. It is ridiculous. Huge giveaway. But in the USA, there are new VW plants being built with huge government giveaways, massive government assistance. Americans are going to be paying a premium price for the Volkswagen bus and Volkswagen SUVs, anything to do with light type trucks. They're going to continue to pay a ridiculous price because the chicken tax will never be revoked. No president has the guts and or the desire to want to revoke the tax. The Americans don't know about it. Most Americans have no clue. A 35 year old American going for an F-150 pickup truck expects to pay $60,000 to $100,000 for a brand new pickup truck. That's what the prices have always been. You don't realize the prices could be $40,000 to $60,000 for the same rig. If I had the opportunity to acquire a Mercedes Benz pickup truck made specifically for the American market, built in Germany, by German expertise, it would kick the ass off a Ford F-150. The GMC would be laughed at by everybody in the trades. Carpenters, contractors, they would shift over to Benz trucks in a microsecond. They'd be $25,000 less than the F-150 and would have way more performance and wouldn't rust out. They wouldn't break down as much. They'd have a longer warranty. But American car companies have ripped off the American people with the assistance of the U.S. government for 48 continuous years and it continues on. Just saying. What you think is free enterprise in the United States or Canada is not. So much of our countries are supported or backed by government intervention and hidden tariff rules that no one will talk about. You do not ever see a presidential candidate for the United States ever talk about repealing all of these hidden tariffs that are in effect hidden taxes on Americans. You never see it because it'll hurt domestic businesses that need artificial assistance to be competitive with the rest of the world. It is an invisible cloak of defense for American and Canadian businesses that live off of socialistic programs that our governments have enacted over the last 50 years and will never repeal it. That is the name of this game. If you don't think that Boeing lives off of subsidies, you are dreaming in technical. There are no U.S. makers of locomotives that can rival Japanese locomotives, French locomotives, Chinese locomotives, German locomotives for passenger trains. There are no manufacturers in America. Yet the technology of these sophisticated high-end rail vehicles were probably created in America. The factories aren't here and they're not coming because the United States government is so overwhelmed with the domestic auto businesses, lobbyists, there will not be high-speed rail lines between Portland and Chicago, Seattle and St. Louis, St. Louis and Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Miami. There will never be a high-speed rail network on par with the rest of the planet in the United States and Canada too because we have been bribed out. Our lobbyists have bribed out every single politician that needs to be bribed out to stay the hell away from high-speed rail. The automobile and the truck and the SUV is safe and sound in North America and while all that is going on, all that is happening, the lobbyists are working as hard as they can on behalf of the automobile companies to lessen, to lower the fuel standards. They're trying to get the government to agree to a new formula to enhance fuel economy. They're trying to say, look, if a car has a wheel base like a little Fiat, then it should get 50 miles to the gallon. But if it has a wheel base like an SUV, it should do 30 miles to the gallon. If it's got a wheel base like a quarter ton pickup truck with an extended cab, it should have 22 miles to the gallon fuel standard. It shouldn't have 40 miles to the gallon. The automobile business in America and Canada is working as hard as they can to not improve their product at any cost ever. They want to get as much money as they can for the product and deliver as little as they can for it. And if that means burning more fuel, so what? If it means a lousier performance, who gives a crap? If the car doesn't last as long as it would in Europe, who gives a crap about Europeans? North American businesses are experts at trying to give you as little as possible for as much as they can possibly get because they're greedy. And that's the capitalist system. And if you can utilize the government to get you there, even better, because politicians are stupid. They don't know jack squat about the car business. You ever watch one of these committee meetings when they want to talk to the president of Google or the head of Apple about their product, so they want to talk about the internet, and they don't know what they're asking these people. They don't know jack shit. They haven't got a clue what's going on. They're fossils, number one. They're 65 and older. They don't know anything about business. They're politicians full-time, and they're bribed by the super PACs. Easy pickings for the defense industry, the automobile industry, the health industry, the pharmaceuticals, the cigarette companies. I mean, come on. What's the best job you can get in Washington? Either be a senator or be a lobbyist towards the senators.\n",
      "congressman. Lobbyists make more money than the politicians that they're going after. It's a great business. There you go. Just some thoughts for you just to kind of think about what can I say? Anyway, there you are. Let's see what's going on. Am I missing any comments? Brian number 212, good morning. Splare, go GameStop. I want to write 19s. What else is going on here? Thank you all. I think I may have read these already. Where are we here? There we go. Maria Powell. I have learned not to panic and just roll when you're out of it. Extrinsic value. It took me a while to ignore the gain loss column. This helped me so much. Brian, Maria, I feel for you. Market goes up and down. Change your position when you feel it's right for you. Arms folded. JJ, I remember that episode of WKRP where they dumped turkeys, not chickens. Splare, in Poland the wheat from Ukraine is making problems. I have to think about it because of this chicken. Brian, Ryan Cohen tweeted, sorry. It is a picture of him as an old man. Ha ha. Hector, Splare, too much Ukrainian wheat into Poland or not enough. JR, got a friend who swears that tariffs level the playing field but ignores the fact that there is such a thing as retaliatory tariffs and unlevel the playing field again. It's just an inflationary move. JR, they are taxes on the American public because those tariffs costs are passed on to the consumer. Exactly right. The deep value Honda EV SUV looks fun. JJ, speaking as a big fat slob Uncle Bruce, I'm really not surprised. Touchgrass, will we be able to tow my Airstream? That's what I want to know. Brian, Touchgrass probably has EVs that have high torque. JR, okay. SPY, come and get me. Take me out of my iron condors. I dare you to put $1,000 into my account. Come on, I dare you. JR, the whole dang country is living off the government dime. Yes, it's true. Charlie, I agree with you about the quality of a Mercedes truck. Problem is that when it does need maintenance, then it's crazy expensive. My daughter had a BMW Mini Cooper. Throw the car away. JR, don't get me started on high-speed rail. It's a sore spot for us Californians after Jerry pulled his shenanigans. Charlie, it was unfortunate that the Mini Cooper was a fun little car. It was a niche vehicle that evoked some pleasure as driving those stupid VWs. Stephen, headed for the dentist. It would be nice if SoFi went up while I was there so I can afford the Novocain laughing out loud. Thank you all. The Dow is off 71. Spire is at $4.65, up 24. Enphase down $3.23. Spiders are down $1.71. Q's are down $3.13. GameStop just down $0.03 at $14.84. We've got SoFi now just down a dime at $7.37. Apple's down $48. Netflix down $7.30. Adobe's down $5.10. AI is at $23.99, down $0.12. Nvidia is still holding a $0.28 gain. Tesla's down $2.50. Rocket Lab is unchanged. Matterport down $4. Smart ran up $3.50. Owens Corning up $80. ATIP unchanged. Unity down $57. Google down $124. Moderna down $3. Cisco down $60. Pfizer down $23. IBM is down $29. HPQ down $6. Microsoft is down $2.35. ME down $0.03, $3.80. Amazon down $1.90. Home Depot $1.52 lower. VanEck down $1.06. Goldman down $1.53. Boeing down $0.70. Meta down $4.86. Target down $0.83. JPMorgan down $0.65. Costco $3.61 lower. Walmart down $0.72. Disney down $0.08. American Airlines up $0.15. DraftKings down $0.48. And AMC is up $0.32, along with Royal Caribbean up $0.37. So there's some quotes there. It's mixed bag. Yeah, we're down, but 66 points on the Dow. Big deal. I mean, so what? S&P not doing all that much. Let me get a refresh on these markets for you. GameStop just went green, $14.89. It looks like we're green on GameStop. Let's take a look here. Master, sorry, markets, markets, U.S. market. Come on, come on, big, big boy. Here we go. Down $47 on the Dow. We seem to be improving. We're down $18 on S&P, $93 on NASDAQ. Oil is down $0.95 right now. All right, there it is. That's the story. You know, 0.15 of a percentage point loss on the Dow. Big whoop. Yeah, the U.S. economy, the Canadian economy, we have such deep-rooted, socialistic handouts, especially in the defence industry. It is ridiculous. What the American government is paying and what the Canadian government is paying for bullets, shells, cannons, tanks, personnel carriers, it's unbelievable. There aren't 20 companies out there bidding to produce most products for the American defence industry. It's usually one or two, maybe three. And the U.S. defence department is getting hosed left, right and centre, which means the American taxpayer is getting ripped off left, right and centre. And the biggest budget in the world for the biggest thing in the world is the U.S. defence budget. It never gets checked. It never gets audited. It never gets called to account. No one goes to jail ripping off the American consumer or taxpayer from the U.S. military spending. I mean, it never, never happens. It's almost impossible. And yet, occasionally, we get a little glimpse, you know, how a screwdriver costs $1,000 or a toilet in a submarine is $10,000 or, you know, crap like that, garbage like that. It's almost never revealed. It is so deeply buried under national security, American taxpayers haven't got a clue how badly they're getting screwed by corporate America. It's corporate America. Look, when you go to, if you ever get to a Super Bowl, go to the local executive airport, stand outside and with all the other airplane watchers, or if you haven't got time to do that, go to go to YouTube and just type in for a search, private jets, Kentucky Derby, 2023, 2022, the Masters near Augusta, private jets, Augusta, 2023, 2022. You will see videos of spotters, private jet spotters, well done, edited video, showing jet after jet coming in and taking off, telling you what the jet is and probably telling you who owns it. This jet is owned by General Dynamics. This jet is operated by General Foods. This jet is operated by IBM. This is from Apple. This jet is from Sony. You will see how corporate America lives the high life with these private jets. It's stunning. You'll then find out if you ever do some digging, how many jets does Netflix, sorry, net jets, pardon me, net jets operate? How many jets does Signature Jets operate on an hourly charter basis? How many private jets are chartered by the hour by corporate America? You will be blown away, blown away how little you get versus how much they have. And many of them are experts at sucking billions out of the American government in Washington. It is an absolute stunning number. And it's the kind of number that no one ever talks about on the political trail, ever. Because if you're a politician looking to become a senator or you want to become a congressman, you want to become, God forbid, President of the United States, you want to run for these kinds of offices, you need corporate America backing. You need, in some cases, billions of dollars for your campaign or certainly millions of dollars for your campaign. And the one thing you do not do is piss off corporate America. You don't do that. You don't talk about it. You keep it on the QT. You talk about what they want to talk about, and you don't talk about what they don't want you talking about. And the one area they don't want you talking about is how many billions of dollars the pharmaceutical companies get from the United States taxpayer. Check out the jets that these guys operate. Why is it that Bombardier and Lear Jets and General Dynamics and all these other jet manufacturers produce $80 million private jets for the best, the top, they call it the richest people in the world. That's not true. They don't produce it for the richest people in the world. They produce it for the richest corporations of the world that then allow their top people to use these jets. All the board of directors, all the top executives of these companies. So you're talking about some public companies that have 10 private jets. There are other public companies that don't own any private jets. They lease the jets or they rent them by the hour through fractional jet\n",
      "ownership programs or hourly jet programs, thousands of them, thousands of these entities that use it. So that on their books, you can't find when you look up in the financial report, does this public company have a private jet? No, they don't. It doesn't show, we don't have a private jet. No, they don't. But are they leasing private jets from time to time? Oh yeah, sure as hell are. That's the world that's out there. These top people, you know, these top executives, they don't go into airplanes at the airport. No, no, no. They go to the executive airport and they do their, they get their private flights and their public flights and their corporate flights all subsidized or handed out to them as part of their perks. This is how, how profitable it is to be a corporate entity in America. But hey, it's the American dream, isn't it? And there are those out there who are getting it and then there are those who are not. And Kaiser Permanente employees, 75,000 of them are on strike right now. Automobile workers, hundreds of thousands of them are on strike right now. The writers and the actors in Hollywood have been on strike. The top studios have private jets. The automotive companies have private jets. Healthcare companies, oh, they have private jets. Yeah, that's, and that's just one way to figure it out, let alone their corporate executive limo fleets on top of that. Then there are the corporations who own penthouses or, or nice condos in New York, in Washington, in London, in Paris, in Tokyo for corporate executives to use. There's all these perks at the top end that most of you don't know about. I'm just trying to get you to make some money writing options. I'm just trying to get you near that area. Maybe I can get you into premium economy or a business class next time you go for a trip. Anyway, what can I say? Thank you, everybody. JR, Touchgrass, as I've mentioned before, there are already big rigs hauling on the freeways here that are full electric. Yes, it's a common splare, too much wheat for way too cheap a price compared to our wheat for our citizens. This is an issue. JR. Maria, yes, I got that. It's just that SPY is testing my short puts and I want to reset. My goal is to at least 1,000 more. And then I'm so close. I'm getting, getting better at rollovers. Uncle Bruce, I really am getting better at this. Thanks for putting away the wet noodles. A splare canopy, 15% back to almost 80 cents. Closed my second one on calls almost completely. JR, when Congress refuses to pass rules banning members trading in the market, I realize how much we are getting screwed. Brian, JR, yes, that was probably a very one-sided vote for no. They're all millionaires because of trading with insider information. JR, hmm, I should, should I, what do we got? Should I make a run for Congress? Imagine how many rollovers I would have to make. Well, when I get there, I'll share the info with the bagelers. Maybe not. Brian, Uncle Bruce, I'm trying to sell five April 18s on GameStop for about two bucks. Use this to buy 1,000, one time, more deep into money. Bring my January 20, 25, $10 average down. Then I have five more calls I can write. I will write these five on GameStop moons. Brian, ha, ha. Alberto, I am laughing my ass off. Love when he curses. Splare, JR, oh man. Brian, Alberto, I am behind by five minutes. The anticipation is killing me. Alberto, Brian, he's going in. That, that, that's the Uncle Bruce I signed up for laughing out loud. JR, I think the only moon we'll see from GameStop is the backside. Don't forget, Brian. Alberto, GameStop is a, is a stagnant stock. Average down and get out, get into a better paying stock. There you go. There you have it. It's all up to you how you want to play it. If you want to keep into GameStop, stay there. You want to shift out of GameStop and shift into AI, deep in the money calls. You know, it's a $25 stock. Maybe you can buy 10s or 15s over there and then write some higher premium call. It's up to you. You know what to do now. If you've taken my classes, you know what you're supposed to be doing. Dow Jones down 45 points right now. A 20 point dip on S&P. Nasdaq down 100. Oil down 32 cents at 83.90. So there you go. GameStop 14.81 or so down 6 cents. SoFi down only 5 cents now. SoFi is coming around. Apple down 35. Adobe down 5.60. Netflix down 8 bucks. AI down just a quarter. Tesla down 3.10. There you go. We're still up 20 cents on the old Spire, holding a gain here. Sooner or later the street will figure out Spire's true potential upside. They'll get it, but not yet. It's not yet evident. $4.61 on Spire. And that's all I can say about that. Can I say that's the way it is? Let's see here. JR Alberto.\n",

SPYs are only down a buck 44. Qs are down 2.90. The Spider got down to 4.20, 2.60. It's now 4.20, 3.25. Let's see if there's any more upside there. The NASDAQ is down 86 and the S&P down 16, but it's barely four-tenths of a percentage point for the S&P 500 and two-thirds of a point for NASDAQ. Not a lot of downside here. Alberto, JR, he's on fire. Let's go, Uncle Bruce. Wish my PayPal was active. Definitely would have been a donation show. Splare, but I wrote already twice down the road with these spreads and bought back for almost nothing. A little pop during the two months would be helpful. There you go. Well, kids, like I said, we're just trying to figure out this game. It might be a rigged game out there, but for option writers, you're on the side of all the pros. You are where the smart money is. You are where the big money is. You are writing calls with people that can afford to rent jets at $5,000 to $10,000 an hour of flying time. These are the folks you're hanging with. Now, you're not writing as many as they are. It doesn't matter. It's all relative to the world you're in. If I can help you make $1,000 a week, $10,000 a month, $20,000 a month, if that builds and builds and builds, you too will have a different lifestyle than you're used to now. It's that simple. Stick around long enough and let it happen. That's all there is to it. Make sure you take the classes. All righty. The Google Condor dropped so fast. I'm waiting for your price to hit, says Spicy. Like I said, you can adjust the prices on the Condor. You can work it out. It's okay. You might be adjusting the pricing of your calls and puts, but you get the general idea of what I'm trying to tell you to do. I would write $20,000, $26,000 only when the stock's at $30,000 to get the highest premium down the road, says Splatter. Alberto, I've cancelled my Howard Stern show. Uncle Bruce is now my Howard Stern show. There you go. I appreciate that, my friend. I try not to swear because I know that there are folks who are listening to me who have kids in the area and so I try to keep it PG friendly. You know where I'm coming from. You know, you've been here long enough. You know. We're only down four points on the Dow now. We're only down four points. This market has come around. Spiders are down 110. Q's are down 265. So we may have a little rally going, a little sell off, another rally, another sell off. Just hang around. GameStop down seven. SoFi down one penny. That's it. 746 on SoFi. Did you buy any cheap today, anybody? Did you get it at the low of the day? Dude, somehow less politics with Uncle Bruce versus Stern's show. Laughing out loud, Splatter. On my AI spread, by the way, I gained 550 and lost 400. That's a 150 gain for three, four weeks on a turnabout. $400 investment. There you go. You're making money. Just make money any way you can. Make money, everybody. Thank you all for all of your support of this channel. I want to say thank you to Israel and Tel Aviv. Jen and I have had a wonderful time here. We're going to get together with Beach Boy tonight one more time and say our goodbyes. We will be in the air tomorrow. We'll be traveling tomorrow to Zurich. So look for us on Monday from Zurich in Switzerland as we arrive there. Thank you all so much for just being with us all the time. We just love you guys. This trip has been something else. So I'll tell you that. We are, as I said, traveling tomorrow and we're going to be, I'm just trying to remember if I got my dates right. We might not be on the air Monday. I think Monday is another travel day. Yeah. As a matter of fact, you will not see us until Tuesday of next week, the 10th. We will be in Zermatt. We're traveling out of Switzerland, out of Zurich on Monday, getting in on Friday, leaving on Monday. We'll be in Zermatt for the rest of the week. You'll see us from\n",
      "there. After that, you will catch up with us out of New Jersey either in person or watching me on the air back and forth. The 21st of October is the meet and greet in New Jersey, and then the next week, latter part, we'll be back in Calgary. So stick around with us and follow with us, and don't mind the gaps in our coverage as we travel to our next destination Thank you all for subscribing to this channel. Thank you for those of you who have been letting us know how long you've been a member of this channel. Thank you. 125 thumbs ups. Thank you again for those thumbs ups. They really help the channel get exposed to first timers. Appreciate that very much. Thank you for taking the lessons. Thank you for booking one-on-ones. Thank you for becoming Gold Bagel members, chilling with Uncle Bruce members and subscribers to this channel. Thank you for becoming subscribers. We love you for that. We'll keep you posted on how it's going. We'll be in Zurich. As I say, we're heading there tomorrow. You'll see us on the air Tuesday from Switzerland. Keep the drive alive, everybody. Keep making money out there. Do what you got to do. Make your trades work for you. Spire is sitting at $4.50 at this point in time. So far, $7.46 down just one penny. All right, everybody. Thank you so very much. Let's see. It looks like Stephen can now afford Novocain's Charlie Splare just in case. Have a good one today and stay relaxed. I wish you safe travels. What was on your menu last night? Oh, my God. I had rye bread with schmaltz and some horseradish. I had grandma's soup, which was chicken noodle soup with sliced carrots. It was wonderful. And then I had sliced roast beef with mashed potatoes and coleslaw. Jen had—what did you have yesterday? We had pickles on the table, some chopped liver, which I didn't have. Cucumber salad. What was that called? I can't remember. Yeah. And Beach Boy ended up with some goose. And he had the schmaltz with me. He also had some cucumber salad. It was wonderful. We had some beer. It was definitely a Jewish deli, a traditional Jewish deli. Oh, gosh, yeah. He had some chocolate ice cream and you had some kugel, which is kind of a chocolatey kind of a pastry. Oh, she had a beef knish as well. Wonderful. Tonight we're going Italian. We're going Italian tonight. So we'll see how that works out. Rumors of a lemon pie of some kind in the offing as well. So we're going to have some fun tonight. And then we are out of here very, very early tomorrow on a crazy flight, but it's the way it is. And then we're in Zurich in the afternoon, and we're going to be dog-tired by the time we get there. So bear with us. We'll be on the air Tuesday with you again, and we'll keep it going. So today no show as well. It was a Friday show. Yeah, today's Thursday. No Friday show. No Monday. Tuesday we'll be back. BW Zurich, you say lots of private banks in that land. You've got Israel, then the Zurich. It's all starting to be pieced together. Nice fake suitcase background from Calgary. There you go. Splare, you're making me hungry. Sounds tasty. Dude, sounds delicious. Sure was. We were stuffed. I was so full I couldn't eat dessert. I couldn't do it. Couldn't do it. Couldn't eat anymore. It was unbelievable. It was fantastic. Okay, everybody. Have yourselves a great couple of days. We'll take a long weekend. Make money tomorrow. Keep me posted on how you're doing. Send me emails. And we'll see you on Tuesday from Zermatt in Switzerland. We can't wait to get there. We have been counting the days. Have a wonderful weekend. In the meantime, thank you for all your support and keep it going, everybody. We'll talk to you real soon. Thank you so very much, everyone. Bye for now.\n",
      "Boom. All right. Hey, everybody. How you doing? It's your buddy Uncle Bruce here live on October the 12th, Thursday, October the 12th, 2023, live from Zermatt, Switzerland. How are you all? Thank you for joining me today. Great to have you here. Jen and I are alive and well. Jen Jr. has arrived as well to see us. And she is so relieved that her parents are A-OK having been in Israel just a few days ago, just last week, as are we. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. We had a fantastic time visiting with Beach Boy in Tel Aviv. We enjoyed ourselves. It was great. There were a few quirky things that I mentioned that I've mentioned before on this show and my other channel. It is not going to Tel Aviv is not like going to New York. There are tall buildings, and there are restaurants, and there are cars, and yeah, a lot of similarities. But oh, it's not the same. And it's not the same as being in Europe. But then if you know anything about the history of the Middle East, you kind of know why. What we didn't know, of course, was that when we left Israel on Friday last week, the 6th of October, we had no idea that within 24 hours, everything would change instantaneously. And we certainly would have had no inkling at all of the kind of carnage that was going to hit that region in just 24, 48 hours. I mean, we just had no one did. I mean, let's be honest. Nobody really could have seen this coming. Really scary stuff. So Jen and I are thrilled that we're here in Zermatt. We're thrilled to be in Switzerland. This is towards the end of our European trip this year. Jen Jr. has rendezvoused with us here for a few days, which is absolutely fabulous. And Jen and I will head to Munich next week. And then we will be in New Jersey, New York and New Jersey, by the end of next week. And we will see a number of you folks in nine days. In nine days, the 21st of October, we have a meet and greet in a place called Secaucus, New Jersey, near the Meadowlands. There's an Outback Steakhouse in Secaucus, New Jersey that we will be conducting our meet and greet in. And we are very much looking forward to those of you who are coming out who sent me a private email. If you can make it, let me know. Send me a private email. I'll just say, hey, Bruce. I'm coming with my friend, my wife, my husband, whatever. We're going to see you. We'll be at the Outback. And it's 1 o'clock, Saturday afternoon, the 21st of October, from like 1 to 3, 1 to 4, something like that. It's nothing too formalized. But come on out and have a bite to eat on us and come and join us. I'm looking forward to seeing you guys. A lot of you will meet each other as well. Many of you who are here all the time, you will meet each other for the first time. And that, I think, is going to be even just as great. Because a lot of you talk to each other all the time through Discord and here on the show. And so this is a chance for people to meet people. I'm looking forward to the get-together. After that, the 24th or so, we fly back home to Calgary. And that will conclude our summer trip. And our next mission after that is we, Jen and I, we've got to get her to her doctor in Palm Desert Ranch Mirage area. The hip she had installed last year perfectly, working perfectly fine. She is pain-free, loving life. She is so happy. Unfortunately, the knee on that same leg, the arthritis, has really kicked in badly. And we had been warned by the medical people that sooner or later, those knees of hers, you might have to consider a replacement surgery. And we think we have hit the road on her one knee. So we may well be heading to California in the not-too-distant future upon our return to Calgary. Not that that is a foreign place. We're very familiar with the area. But we may be down there in November, certainly December, which unfortunately means that our trip that we had planned that we were hoping to do to Australia and New Zealand is not going to happen this year. We've got to get Jen looked after for that knee of hers, because she's just suffering way too much. She's a trooper. She's frustrated. But we will get it done. And we'll go from there. So anyway, that's the immediate part of the world and what we're dealing with here. Like I said, we're happy to be here. We're at this resort here in Zermatt in this one hotel we were here before. And they have a wonderful, they have these therapy pools here, which we wanted to visit again. And Jen really is getting her body looked after. She's allowing the therapeutic waters to help with her legs or back. Just like for myself as well, it's very therapeutic. And our daughter is here joining us. So we're great. We're doing fantastic. Thanks to all of you out there for being subscribers and members of this channel. We are doing our thing. And Jen and I are looking very much forward to seeing you in person. And of course, getting back together with you on a more regular schedule when we return back to Calgary. So thanks all for being here. It's great to see you all. The markets this morning, we're looking all right. We just saw some news come through here on the initial jobless claims number of 209,000 in the last week. That's flat. There's a 3.2% cost of living allowance that's going to be enacted for Social Security recipients. So that's an inflation adjustment coming through on top of the one from last year. So that will kick in for 2024. We saw the inflation report come through. That just came out. I think it said something like 3.7% if I got that right. Increase in core CPI, or they say it drops to 4.1% in September from 4.3% in August. That's one of the numbers we're waiting for. There are more yet to come. Waiting for some more reports. But so far, so good. The pre-market looks quite all right. At the moment, I'm seeing that we have the Dow being positive now, 155 points, which I think is the high of the day. We've got S&P now up 18.75 points and NASDAQ up 57 points. So we were only up a third of a percentage point about a half an hour ago. It looks now like we're inching up like 0.45, 0.42 for the Dow, the S&P, and 0.38 for NASDAQ. Crude oil is $1.38 higher at $84.87. We were in that $83.50 range last night. So a little higher on oil, but not like it was the other day. And we'll see just how this plays out. I personally don't think oil can hold the gains. But it's a matter of a number of factors that we have to watch for, one of which is the Israeli situation. We've got to wait it out. Will that be escalating at all? Or is it going to be a Gaza Strip West Bank issue? Or are we talking about Lebanese problems to the north or anything else? At the moment, we don't see anything else happening. Oil will react if other actors get into this. So we'll have to see just where this plays out. All right, so that is the story at the moment. As I'm following these developments that are many at the same time. 36 thumbs ups and counting, everybody. Thank you for that. Keep them coming in if you can. Appreciate it. Robert Benson, Flint Creek, good day. Kamakohoname is here. Welcome. Drew is here. Hector's here. Ricardo's here. Karen's here. Amy's here. Welcome all to the show. The regulars are popping.\n",
      "in as always. And it's great to have you in the in the house. Game stops 1584 up a couple of cents after touching 16 yesterday. So by 860 this morning, we were pushing 865 to 870. So by seems to be by a little by little by little by little every day or so just inching higher at nine bucks is our next stop. After being as low as 740 what a week and a half ago week ago, we're now moving higher. The earnings for so five will come out in 18 days. And we've got Friday tomorrow, then Saturday, Sunday, that's you know, three days right there. Next weekend coming and going. We are down to not that many trading days left before we get the report from so far. So the shares are, in my opinion, we could be over 10 bucks a share by the time the release comes out. It's very feasible that the shares could be 10 1050 when the report comes out, which is I think Monday, the 30th of October if I am not mistaken. Yes, Monday, the 30th. So maybe Friday, the 27th, which is next week, Friday, we might already be in a in a scenario where, you know, we're already watching the stock run its way up towards 10 plus. Like I said, I wouldn't bet against I will not bet against it. I'll tell you that I'm thinking that that may well be exactly what's what's going to happen. We'll see. All right. Other other stocks are coming out with more announcements about their earnings. We're beginning to see more and more companies confirm their earnings dates. We know that Matterport was November 9, I think Rocket Lab November 8, ME November 6, Spire November 7, ATIP November 14, Smart Rent November 9, AI November 28, GameStop December 7. GameStop is always towards the very end of these. We'll watch for all of those. Obviously, in the next, you know, three, three, four weeks, everyone will be out telling us what they're doing and how their numbers are going. And I've been watching again, with great interest, I'm keeping an eye on one other thing. For those of you who are not, if you're not a member of this channel, specifically, if you're not a Gold Bagel member, you have not been getting the trade alerts, the the the trade tip videos. Every day that I'm on the air, I try to produce a trade of the day tip for you a trade to consider. And back on September the 19th, for example, which is you know, coming next week, it's a week, it's a month from now, I recommended at that time, after a pretty brutal drop in value, Rocket Lab, it was down into the 355-65-70 range, for no good reason. The only reason was because a satellite launch had not worked out the second stage where Rocket failed or something. The shares just got whacked. I mean, just got whacked. No reason for it, but they did. And I looked at that and I just yelled at you guys. I put a video out for Gold Bagel members, buy the Rocket Lab immediately, just buy it, buy it, buy it. And a bunch of you followed me on that you went ahead and scored it and a lot of you got Rocket Lab under 425, 410, 4 bucks, 380, 375. Rocket Lab yesterday, I think touched five something. We have been, you know, floating this. Yeah, yesterday 507 was the high yesterday. We're at 479-480 right now, but we are inching back up over five here. And it's only a matter of time before this stock does go through the five and stay over five going forward. So good to see that. And I'm glad that a number of you took advantage of that climb, of that dip to get into this thing and get a little return. As I said, if you're a Gold Bagel member of this channel, you're paying 25 bucks a month to be here. If I can give you a stock tip that can make you more than $300 in profit, there's a whole year of being a Gold Bagel member. You're going to get all the other stock tips for nothing. The entire joining of this channel for nothing. The pre-alert show is free. So I'm doing what I can to give you a payback for being a member of this channel on the Gold Bagel level. And again, congratulations to those of you, I know some of you out there picked up a couple of thousand shares or more of Rocket Lab at super cheap prices. Some of you are already ahead a buck a share on the trade. I love it. I think you're going to make much more than that. And so beautiful. If you bought 300 shares and you're up a dollar a share, that's $300. There's the whole year covered for the Gold Bagel membership up front. So nice. Well done. A comical name number 34. Who cares? Number 39. Not your SoFi. Got some back. Number 40. Welcome all for joining the channel today and letting me know what number you are on the thumbs ups meter. GameStop 1587. High yesterday, I think we touched 1609. And I think we're going higher on the GameStop. The selloff is over. Cohen has stepped in. He's now CEO. He's running the entire show. No more speculation about management departures. He's the guy. And I think now that he is in total control in the boardroom and at the upper level, I think this company is going to make money. I just know it. They're going to make money. These higher interest rates are fitting falling into place for GameStop because they're sitting on I think 1.2 billion in cash. They're probably hauling in 60 million a year in interest. That's pure profit to the company. They're gonna make money. They're on the profit side. They've cut their expenses on their head office, corporate expenditures, highfalutin benefits and stuff that they were paying these former senior executives. Those guys are all gone. They're all gone. SoFi is going to make money. We're going to find out in the not too distant future also how AI is going to do and NVIDIA with their next quarter. AI spending is not letting up. There's no end to that. I've noticed today the UAW has increased their strike mandate. They're now on strike against Ford at their Louisville. Is it Louisville, Kentucky? There's a truck plant, an F-150 truck plant. 8,700 workers have walked off. No more Mr. Nice Guy. They've tried now for what, five weeks to cut a deal with these auto guys. It's time to start striking at other plants. I'm just thinking what they ought to announce is a full blown shutdown of all the factories for the entire industry. Just announce to the members stay home for a month. Don't even bother coming back to work for a month. Make them pay. Make it hurt. You want to get the attention of the auto industry and you want to get attention of Wall Street, the bankers of Wall Street. Tell your members to stay home for a month and get strike pay for a month. Because frankly, the car companies can't make a deal with the union one on one, then the car companies can take phone calls from Wall Street. When Wall Street starts calling and says, hey, look, you guys are into a $20 billion of debt with us here. Those 200,000 workers walked off the job, you're shut down completely. You're not delivering a pickup truck, let alone a convertible. How long can you guys hold out before you are going to be in real cash flow trouble? This is not good. Every week is I think every week is a billion or two in lost profits. Wake them up, give them a Will Smith dope slap and just walk off the job. I have no mercy for these guys. They've been playing shenanigans now for 15 years with these unions. And they have screwed these guys into cheaper and God awful deals and I think union has got to get their mojo back on getting control of the situation. Anyway, I don't like it when grandfathers and fathers were getting the equivalent of 60 bucks an hour and the kids are getting an equivalent of 15 to 20 bucks an hour. People are looking at them going, well, you're not working hard enough. That's why you're not successful. I don't think so. I think that they have been slapped around so badly with these concession deals. Just like the airline employees, many are getting a fraction of what they used to get. Have you noticed how much fun it is to go on a plane ride lately? It's not fun anymore. It used to be glamorous and really a really doughty. It ain't fun anymore. Everyone's upset. And can you blame airline attendants for the behavior?\n",
      "of the passengers. Oh my God. Okay. I can't believe it that if you're an airline attendant, you only get paid when the jet engines are turned on. Did you know that? When the jet comes to the gate and they shut off the engines and the passengers get off and it takes like 40 minutes for everyone to get up, they're not getting paid anymore. They're only paid when the plane is running. It's ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. The airlines have screwed their members down to nothing. And uh, I don't, I just, it just drives me nuts. The cost of an airplane ticket in reality, in an inflation adjusted manner compared to what we used to pay for an airline ticket in the seventies and the eighties and the nineties is way cheaper. We're paying far less money to the airlines. Now what we're paying to government, what we're paying to the TSA, what we're paying to the Canadian government, the British governments, the, the EU governments, all these airline authorities, all these so-called security fees and all this crap. Those are taxes. All right. Those are being piled on, piled on and piled on because these guys, these governments won't tax their own citizens in their home countries, real taxation. So they're making the passengers pay. The airlines are caught in the middle. They're just caught in this vortex of a terrible situation and they're taking it out on their employees. And these employees, how, how much do you want to work for an airline as a, as a flight attendant? Uh, when you've got upset customers up and down the aisleways, it's not a glamorous job at all. So Adam, special kudos to the flight attendant, special kudos to the folks making our cars, cars and trucks, uh, hard working people, all the folks working at the parts suppliers, the battery companies, the tire companies, those who are making, uh, all the frames and all the parts for the automotive sector. Kudos to hardworking people in North America, because these folks here are getting taken for a ride by the millions. Uh, they were at one time able to retire with dignity and a middle-class lifestyle. Not anymore. You work for 40 years at a GM car plant or whatever. You're lucky if you're employed for 40 years and at the end of it, you haven't got a lot to show for it because, uh, I don't think there's a huge pisspot of dough sitting in a retirement account that you can count on. Uh, but anyway, it is what it is. You guys who are here, I say congratulations to you. You've taken the ball into your hands to make money in this market yourselves and do it here. More power to you. You have to do it because there are wars, there are disagreements, there's inflation, there's high interest rates, there's a recessions, there's a crazy real estate, there's all kinds of crap going on out there. You got to find a way to make it work for you. And if you can make it work through option writing, well done everybody. Thanks. Coffee Kids Trading is here. Splare is here. Uh, uh, San GM's here. More corporate shenanigans. Uh, uh, Microsoft owes IRS 28 billion in non-paid taxes. You know what I read this morning? The, uh, the folks at Microsoft, they made a point of saying that since 2003 to today, uh, they have paid $67 billion in income tax to the U S government. And I'm sure that, that, that, uh, Facebook and, and Google and Apple and, and, and, uh, you know, the other magnificent seven and, and Intel's of the world and the other, they've all paid billions as well. It's, it's true. Uh, however, uh, they have found ways legally, they have found ways to avoid full blown taxation because they can afford with the tens of billions that are making, they can afford to hire professionals to help, you know, negate some of these huge tax bills that they would face if they were purely a U S based corporation with all their bases here. Uh, obviously Microsoft's going to fight that, uh, that so-called charge, uh, that 29 billion is made up of interest and penalties. The original amount of tax, I bet you the original amount of taxes, eight to $10 billion. And Microsoft apparently is saying, uh, guys, uh, from the years that you're going after us from Oh three to 13, those 10 years, we weren't the same Microsoft from 2002 backwards from 2003 forwards. Uh, you're trying to tax us on money made overseas that we don't have to pay tax on according to our lawyers. And so guess what? It's going to court. Guess what? It's going to take 10 years to litigate out. Okay. And at the end of the day, what is most likely going to happen? My guess is if there's any kind of a deal to be made at all, it'll be a partial settlement. That'll be just quietly negotiated. And that'll be the end of it might be like a five to $10 billion deal. And that's the end of it. On the other hand, the company may go all the way to the wall. And if they lose their first, uh, their first round, they'll appeal it and they'll delay it another five years. And if they lose that, they'll appeal again. Uh, they'll just take it up and take it up. This is going to take forever. So in the meantime, the company does pay taxes, but uh, unfortunately, um, uh, a lot of taxation that America, the American government could have received from these many, many, many companies, dozens and dozens of big, big American companies, they've all set up offshore operations. And, um, there are probably 300 billion in taxes that just aren't coming here, coming to the USA, uh, or will ever come. I just don't see it. But anyway, that's just, that one has been talked about a million times, uh, over many, many reports. And sometimes it catches some people's attention. Most time it doesn't catch anyone's attention. People just go, whatever, Bruce, blah, blah, blah. I don't care. Um, there you go. All right. Uh, what can I say? What can I say? Jobless report says, uh, the number of people going for claims is under 210,000 for the fourth straight week. You know what that means? Jobs aplenty in America, over 10 million job openings are in the USA right now, unfilled. The auto workers, I can tell you if any of these guys go on a long-term strike, they'll be able to get other jobs in the meantime to pay the bills and they'll be hired by other companies. And you know what, if you're getting 15 to $18 as an auto worker and you have to be out on strike for a month or so, you can get a job for 15 to $18 at many other places. Uh, this, this, this isn't great money anymore. $15, 15 years ago was good money. Not now. Um, you can get that kind of money, uh, working at other corporations. And it might be an interesting development that, uh, if there were to be a full blown strike call by the union for a UAW and it goes on for three, four or five weeks, uh, you may find that 20% of the union members don't come back. They may find that it'll come back to get their bonus checks and stuff. Oh yeah, sure. But within three months they'll walk because unless there's a decent deal there, they can get more elsewhere. Um, it isn't the be all and end all anymore. There was a time that a job in the Detroit area or Michigan or Ohio or Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, you were working for one of the auto plants, you were making really good money, but those days aren't there anymore for 700,000 of the jobs are gone. There used to be a million members. There's 200 something thousand now, and it's not going to get a lot better unless, unless there's been a real turnaround with the three automakers in the union. I don't know. The automakers, I am certain are basically crying, you know, Oh, I'm so, we're so poor. We can't afford it. They want to nail you a 85 grand for an F one 50 with all the bells and whistles that costs 30 grand to make 40 grand to me. But, uh, they cry poor men, you know, we're poor. We can't afford it. In any event, we'll see how it plays. The chicken tax is alive and well and is subsidizing the auto industry to the nth degree to the tune of billions of dollars a year. And no one will talk about it on the record. Uh, crickets are chirping in the background on that splatter. So by suddenly eight 58 to eight 70, uh, Larry, good morning, everybody. Number 51 DHM number 52. Yeah. So far right now, eight 70 up 11 cents. Go. So if I go next stop is nine bucks and let's get going from there. That would be\n",

Um, got people here who deserve a real home run. And uh, I think, uh, maybe we can get one on so far in the near future. Let's see what happens. Alrighty. Let's take a look at the pre-market. Uh, I think we've got, uh, some uptrades here, 4 cents higher on rocket lab. We're, uh, so far up 11 here. GameStop is just down 2 cents. We've got a penny gain on Matterport. It looked like a half a penny gain on, uh, on, uh,\n",
      "23 and me it looks like around 92 and a half to 93 cents Spire is up 12 this morning at 421. We got 80 IP up 9 Looks like it's at 8 or something. I got smart rent up 11 cents. It's coming into 290 a share ever so quietly smart rent might be inching towards this three level It's been a while we haven't seen $3 on the smart rent Since like September 7th or something like that the 8th yeah, September September the 8th the last time we were at anywhere near 3 and And July 31 we're just around 4 so come on smart rent. Let's go the total market cap of the company is 560 million dollars that's the market cap and the The cash on hand right now Let me just take a look here the cash that they've got is 200 million dollars something like that Yeah, yeah, they're they're at least 200 million And then they're they're they're they're assets the company's assets are 521 million and their liabilities are 174 I mean, you know, there's 350 million dollar company in net value And they're trading at at 560 so that's ridiculous. I mean these guys are generating way more cash now than they ever generated There's they're soon gonna start making money. I mean smart rent soon gonna start turning a profit But anyway, the market is you know Impatiently waiting for that day to come I guess but stocks up 11 today We got Apple up 15 cents Goldman up 23 Cisco up 13 Tesla down 44 cents here arc innovations of 16 the Microsoft shares down to 44 I guess on that income tax story 329 99 Pfizer up 3 HP queues up a nickel here was up 40 cents yesterday.

Well, I can see that Looking at the Dow right now the last time I told you what the Dow was doing. We were up 155 We're now only up 89 S&P only up seven and a half thing was up 16 Nasdaq is up 13 points. That was up 50 odd. So we've backed off a bit here crude down. It's up 137 hasn't gone down yet We'll see if that changes a little later Okay dominoes revenue falls as US growth struggles dominoes when a take-home pizza and delivery pizza at home backs off. That's a sign That's a sign of a slowing economy absolutely, I don't see what how I'll see how it work Thank you everybody for for being here. Jr. Wants to know from Flint Creek.

It's gonna be fantastic Looking forward seeing all you kids out there at the old bag gonna be fun Gonna be a good old time. Thank you for thumbs up number 60 now 24 minutes to go and we'll start trading. We're at 60 thumbs ups. Thank you all for coming through for us. It is much appreciated Following as usual the headlines as best we can of course The news out of Israel is what it's all about right now. This is absolutely dominating world press everywhere We'll see how that plays out we're watching the clown show in Washington with now the Republicans formally nominating Scalise to be house speaker unfortunately He only got 113 votes and 99 voted against him to go to Jim Jordan So now the question is it looks like he does not have enough votes to win the house Because I think the Democrats are all gonna vote no So we may be in for a while yet of a complete dysfunction at the Congress. I don't know what to think about this We'll find out what else is going on here Whoo-wee Lots of lots of headlines about housing prices and higher interest rates for mortgages Yeah, apparently AMC CEO Adam Aaron said he was a victim of a blackmail plot Law enforcement had asked him to keep this quiet But after the extortionist was sentenced in July Aaron said he informed the board of what happened there Very very disturbing But he's not going to be able to get out of this He's not going to be able to get out of this Yeah, he informed the board of what happened there very very disturbing And let's see what else is going on here Boy, oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy There's a dozen headlines on the top lots of different subjects and topics Yeah, social security benefits going up 3.2% that is official and This higher than inflation report thing Apparently let's take a look at this a US can prices climbed 0.4% in September the Labor Department said on Thursday It was softer than the 0.6 gain the prior month, but it was hotter than forecast Economists thought it would only be a 0.3% Evidently, it's a 0.4. The 12-month inflation data now is 3.7 And economists are hoping for 3.6% So there you go The shelter costs were the largest contributor to the gain accounting for over half the increase the department said Cost of gasoline was another major factor so There you go higher rents There you go higher rents higher mortgage higher gasoline prices The folks at Saudi Arabia are doing the u.s. No favors and neither in Russia either These guys are basically at war with the g20 countries of the world by Reducing oil exports. They're trying to put the squeeze on oil exports and That is not doing too well For The American economy, obviously, uh, the pound is down the euro is also\n",
      "getting hit right now they've lost half a penny in the last hour just on this news the yen is also losing ground to the US dollar the Swiss franc is losing ground to the Swiss dollar and the Canadian dollar is kind of hanging in there but yeah world currencies are reacting to these inflation numbers as well and so are the the futures market we have 20 minutes to go until we start trading and we know that the Dow is only up now 45 points instead of 155 an hour ago SPS up three and a quarter Nasdaq's only up six points these markets are backing off quickly towards breakeven and maybe into the red oil is dropping it's up 123 was up 140 150 a bit earlier so a little backing up there Maria Powell is here good morning Flint Creek I can't wait to see you guys H Gregory I'm here at number 60 and fantastic and Mandu I number 66 good morning everybody Bruce you're two-thirds of the way to 100 thumbs up says Mandu number five and they're coming in we're at 68 thumbs ups we've got 19 minutes to go the question is can we hit a hundred thumbs ups by the time the market opens up in 19 minutes we need a little push here we're at 69 70 or so 30 more and we've got a hundred thumbs ups can we do it I ask you all thank you for helping out if you are nailing that thumbs up button for us every little bit helps there you go there's the story yeah four straight weeks the jobless claims are below 210 jobs everywhere in America absolutely everywhere that this whole panic thing about well I don't know if it's panic you know you depending on what media you follow again you know I can't help it but there's all kinds of media out there and it satisfies everybody's cravings whether it's real or not I don't know but the so-called immigration crisis that America is under apparently it's now 20 years of a crisis there are 10 million job openings in the United States and there's a simple reason why there are 10 million job openings father time is the reason why there are so many job openings in the US there are job openings in Canada to father time is to blame the the the kovat crisis we had the lockdowns and everything there were millions of Canadians and Americans bribed by their employers to retire early if you were 50 and older during kovat in 2020 the chances are you or someone you know in that age group was bought out offered a deal to take a hike and millions of the North Americans took the deal 55 and 60 year olds 62 year olds they were offered retire now here's a bump here's a thought you know years pay get out they took it they took health care coverage for another year they took a bump in their employment retirement plan they took the vesting of their shares they were bribed out of their jobs they took the money and walked and they stayed at home like the rest of us and waited out the pandemic and a number of folks who were bought out of their jobs in their 50s mid 50s late 50s early in mid 60s a ton of these people got new jobs working from home they're not going to the office anymore they'll never go back some of these folks decided you know what I just got I just got a bunch of dough into my retirement plan here I only have to work another couple of years and I don't even have to work full-time anymore I can work part-time and start collecting my social security and say thank you sir may I have another I'm over 60 I can get Medicare now get rid of those are ridiculous insurance premium a lot of Canadians and Americans decided I'm just gonna work part-time from home and be a consultant with all the years of experience I have in the field that I'm good at they're never coming back and so these job will be this full-time job has reappeared because as the COVID thing ended everything opened up again employers were scrambling for people and they couldn't find them because they had let them go if you let a 25 35 or 40 year old go you can get them back because they can't retire but you let a 55 a 65 year old go you might not ever get them back and all that experience is gone forever from your organization that's the other killer so now you're leaning on your 35 45 year olds to do the work of the 55 year old senior employee you got rid of oh you're in trouble you're in big trouble you need two people and you can't find them qualified so 10 million jobs available and with all the illegal immigration into America and Canada theoretically still 10 million job openings my god what does that tell you the other thing it's telling me not only the COVID wave that got rid of a whole bunch of people of course a number people died during the COVID years let's not forget that but the other reality is a typical career is 40 years you work from 20 to 60 or 25 to 65 it's a 40 year career every year 1 40th of the workforce leaves father time gets rid of them now even if someone works until they're 68 eventually they quit and 1 40th of all the workers are gone so if you've got a company with 400 people 10 a year leave you get a company with 800 people 20 a year leave they die they retire they get some get ill in their 30s and 40s and 50s and can't work anymore there's all kinds of reasons but it's at least 1 40th of the workforce so from 2020 to or 2019 but in the beginning of COVID showed up 2020 when the lockdown happened you take those four years we're almost at the end of 2023 we're taking four years of employees that's 10% of the workforce of Canada the United States Great Britain Europe all the g20 countries 10% of the workforce naturally has left the workforce then another 5 to 10 15% more left the workforce because they got bought out or they died from COVID I mean combination of everything took out another batch this is why there's 10 million job openings just in the United States it's not getting getting solved the United States doesn't want to let new people in it's keep them out keep them out Canada's trying to let people in left right and center and we still have job openings all over the place because all these Canadians have quit their jobs have left their jobs they have they can't work anymore they've passed away whatever the answer they're just not there anymore and away we go kids this continues on no stop to it what can I say I have white feather I think it was number 49 good morning Oliver a houseman hi uncle Bruce I followed one of your iron condor tips on Microsoft two weeks ago I got the puts at 280 90 got the calls at 330 40 I'm trying to roll over the calls for three days would you correct recommend a call both the sides or just the calls well if the contracts are dying in the next couple of weeks you might want to roll the entire position into two weeks out again or three weeks from now further out perhaps the third Friday of November it might be the pick and shift the calls and the puts over there to kind of you know get get higher on the call side and a little higher on the put side you might want to make that move this is where you close this one off and shift into that one the credit you're gonna get creating the new one is going to be much larger than whatever you have to do with this one here so that might be the way to go but otherwise you know if the if the shares of Microsoft right now are sitting here at where we have right now Microsoft 329 67 so we're just underneath your call right 330 340 you know you you would be nice to get the 335 45 or maybe just move your your your written call the 330 to a 335 and leave the 340 along and just move just the 330 to 335 and take the 280 90s and move them to 3 3 2 3 10 or 3 2 3 0 5 or 3 0 5 2 3 10 can you do that but if you can move forward in time with these moves then you know close these two out and bring two new ones on into the third Friday of November and bring in the big money that would be the way to go shift these puts and calls higher to get the market back into the middle of this range way to go white feather I thought Bruce caused the job openings by teaching people how to quit their day jobs of course how many people watch me and have quit their day jobs that's right dude I'm number 76 Bruce Flint Creek any of our soaps work for short hair I'd recommend bar soap for longer colored hair that has to do with\n",
      "the structure of the whatever. Hey, look, I'm thinking body wash myself. Get those pits going. Smell like cashmere down here. Oh, that'd be nice. That sounds pretty nice. Anyway, we'll see. It is what it is. There's a lot of info about soap I don't know about. Yeah, kids, lots of potential out there. You know, these trades that you've gotten into, these trade tips, many of them are well within the ranges. Only that Apple trade is kind of close in, but with the news today, the stock backed off, you may find that once we open for trading, by the way, on that Microsoft Condor, if the stock drops to 325, you're going, I'm sitting on 330 puts or 330 calls and the stock's at 325. You may find that the rollover today is easier. You may find it an easier one to make. So keep an eye on that. But I would start to look at taking the calls from $10 spread to five. That's what I'd want to be doing now if you're working with the same expiry date. And if you can move those puts up and get a credit on them, build a credit on the puts, but you might have to, to really build a huge increase in credit, roll out of these into November 17 Condor contracts and go that direction. All right, Splare. I moved yesterday for an additional 80 bucks to 1375 January's into an April 14 and a 15. I made both extra cash, but mostly of course from the $14 call. Right on, yeah, bigger premium. 865, by the way, on the SOFI did get to this 870, 72 range for a while. The stock just kind of wants to go higher, I think on SOFI, doesn't it? It just sort of is itching to go. That's the way I feel on it. And NASDAQ, by the way, now is unchanged. S&P is up to, the Dow's up 35. NASDAQ now down three quarters of a point. So this market is still sinking as we speak. All right, Oliver, I'm going to consider the options. I'm going to consider all of these. Thank you. You got it, you got it. There's lots to think about here. Get your pen and paper out, get your calculator out. Watch the opening. You may not make a move for a half an hour or an hour. You might wait an entire hour before you even consider doing anything because you want the market to tell you what to do. You don't want to guess the market. They're going to tell you in the first hour what really is going on. If this market is slumping right now, we may find that the Microsoft shares might back off three, four, five hours, down to 326, 327. And at that level, the heat's off. You might go, yeah, there's no rush for me to do a rollover here. Maybe I can just sit back a little bit and hold off. I'm not going to get kicked around here on this thing. That trade I recommended on the 28th of September. And those contracts that I recommended you look at expire October 20th. So they only have eight days to go. And if Microsoft stays under, down around the 325 range, the next like tomorrow and into Monday, you might just be sitting there on Monday or Tuesday going, you know, these three 30s, they're shrinking out real nice. I'm just going to close them out. The puts, I've long made my money on those and I'm rolling now to next month. I'm going to do that. Oliver, Olivier, you could do really well with this. Nice, nice job. And anyone else out there doing the same thing, stay on top of your condors and yeah, make them pay you. You all deserve it. Fantastic stuff. Thank you all for being here.

I think before we open for trading, it might be time to honor the Knights of NEA just to be on the safe side. We just saw the number 90 thumbs up come in here. Might be time to do a little NEAT, NEAT, NEAT announcing there. White Feather, I've said it before, iron condors are perfect for small accounts like mine. Class number 16 is worth its weight in gold.

Let's find out how this market really wants to open up and see what it's got here. JR, this is the first morning I've had the chance to click the emoji balloons on my computer.\n",
      "It wasn't there before. Swear, thanks. Rock on, everybody. JR, thank you, Lair. Well, I'm glad you guys can get the balloons working and the hearts working. Mine are jammed up here. I've got this heart symbol that's been here for an hour. It won't go away. I don't know what to do about it. I do the best I can with what I got. I just reload my show. And no idea what's going to happen next. I try, I try, I try. I tell you, I try. Thank you all for joining in today and being part of the gang. 103 thumbs ups it is. And there we are. We're on a roll. We've opened up the trades and see what we're going on here. With 33 point gain on the Dow, looks like a 3 quarter of a point loss on S&P and 7 point loss on NASDAQ to start the session. And we got $1.42 gain on oil right now at $84.93. So a slight gain there. See how long that lasts. Let's get the latest update here if we can. If I can get my big S iPad to do a refresh. $8.59 on SOFI. Let's see. That's what you get for clicking on the balloons, Uncle Bruce. There he says. $8.57 now down, what, $0.03 maybe or something like $0.02. Nothing serious. We've got the US markets now open. We're up 26 on the Dow. We're positive now on S&P, 3 quarters of a point. Positive 2 thirds of a point on NASDAQ. So they're just kind of hanging around the flat level here. Fool of a Took says, number 103 on the thumbs up meter. Fantastic, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. Let's see what happens here with this market. Spire is up to $4.13 and a half. We've got Enphase holding 127.39 down $1.50 or so. The Spiders are up $0.19. The Qs are up $0.54. GameStop is at $15.66 off $0.16. SOFI, $8.53 down $0.06. Apple is up here about $0.50. Netflix is down $0.18. Adobe up another $5, $5.55. AI up $0.18, make it $0.16 to $26.88, going for $27. NVIDIA up $0.53. Tesla's up $0.98. We've got Rocket Lab up a penny, make it $0.02 now, $4.85. Matterport unchanged. SmartRent down $0.03. We got Unity down $0.12. Google down $0.11. The Moderna's down $0.117. Cisco's up $0.43. Pfizer up a penny. IBM down $0.113. HPQ down $0.09. Microsoft down $0.196. ME down a penny. Amazon is up $1. Home Depot down $1.79. Bannick Vector's up $0.63, now to $1.52. Goldman Sachs down $1.40. Boeing down $1.35. Meta, the old Facebook, up $0.55 to $3.28. We got Target up $2.50. JP Morgan up $0.24. Costco up $1.33. Walmart down $0.11. Disney down $0.12. American Alliance up $0.03. DraftKings down $0.12. AMC up a dime, $10.52 on AMC, by the way, which has been a nice gain now in a week from $8.80 to this level in the month from the $8.20 range. The lows were $8.10, $8.12, $7.18 even. The low for 52 weeks, $7.05 in September. So a $3.40 gain all based on this hype around the Taylor Swift concert movie. That's what really is doing it. I would, if I were AMC right now, I would be taking advantage of this move to try to sell stock through any way I could at 10 bucks a share to raise money and pay down that debt. But hey, if it goes to 11 or 12, good luck to them. I don't know how this movie will really rank out. I don't know, but you hope for the best, but boy, does AMC need a win? A big, big win for sure. Splare is going right on. Senna down two bucks, says Splare. All right. Negative on the Dow now. We've gone into the red. We're down five points. Now we're up two points. We're flat on S&P. We're up six on NASDAQ. Giving up a lot of gains here. Is this as bad as it's gonna get? And now we're gonna have a shot higher or are we gonna drop here? Notice we're not getting a buy wave and go for a bit of a spill. I don't know. We'll see. Oil up 145, 84.95 a barrel right now at the moment. 8.52 on SoFi, down 7 cents. GameStop down 23 to 15.59. Apple's up 33. Netflix down $1.13. Adobe now up 9.31. AI down a nickel. Nvidia up 113. Tesla up 136. Rocket Lab down a couple of pennies. Matterport off one cent. Smart Rent down two. Owings Corning down 251. ATIP unchanged. Unity down 28. Google down 29. Moderna down 99. Cisco up 47 cents. Pfizer down a dime. IBM down 115. HPQ down nine cents. Microsoft off a dollar at 331.39. We'll see how this Microsoft reacts this morning. A low of 329.50 today, and a high of 331.67, and we're at 331.39 right now. So if this Dow goes for a bit of a dump on a little profit-taking binge here, would Microsoft go along with that, with this taxation thing hanging over its head? Otherwise, a rollover city? We'll see what goes here with these iron condors on Microsoft. Boggle says, hi, do you think iron condors are a good trade when it overlaps an earnings report? It depends on the iron condor trade you're trying to do. If you're trying to do a one-week, two-week iron condor trade, and you don't have a lot of range between the calls and the puts, if your range is too tight, earnings report can screw you over. But if you're going out several weeks, maybe a month or longer, depending on the stock, depending on the index or what you're doing, but if you can go on a stock iron condor, and you go forward right now to November, and you can get a range, like on something like Tesla, you can get a $100 range on your stock, earnings report won't be a problem. So it depends on a number of factors, Lesson 16 is waiting here. For those of you who don't know, Luca Bongiorno, just popping in for a quick chow to everybody, and we'll catch rerun later. Thank you, my friend. I'm in Lyon, France for work. Well, you were pretty close. Right on, buddy. Way to go, man. We're on the continent with you, and keep it going, my friend. Just keep it right on going. We're down 22 on the Dow. So there's a bit of a pullback, nothing serious. Well, we're flat on S&P. We're up 13 on the NASDAQ. So it's kind of calm here. We'll see how this all works out. On the Microsoft, which I'm curious about to see how it's working, 331.96. It's trying to recover, still down 46 cents. Now it's down 67 cents. It's drifting along there at the moment. Amazon up 113, but Home Depot down 198. So it's a mixed bag. There's greens, there's reds, no doubt about it. We're down 1920 points on the Dow Jones. All righty. GameStop down 32, SoFi down 12. All right, Steven Butler is in the house, and he is number 108 on the thumbs up meter. Thank you, sir, for that.\n",

      "Appreciate the number 108 thumbs up. Keep them coming, kids. We're into triple digits, and we're climbing on that. Fantastic. Much appreciated, everybody. 30 point drop on the Dow. One point gain on S&P, 16 point gain on NASDAQ for the moment. All righty, kids, there it is. Interesting. Let's take a look over here into our markets. 331.94 down 48 on Microsoft. We've got interest rates here just a bit higher on the 10-year. We got down to 455. We're back to 461 on the 10-year. That is causing, I bet you, the American dollar to rise. It is. The Euro is dropping a half a penny today to 105.66. The pound is off 7 tenths of a penny to 122.44. So it's getting whacked. The yen in Japan is dropping from the 149 range this morning overnight to 149.50 to the U.S. dollar. So it's getting hit. The Australian dollar is getting hit. So the U.S. dollar is definitely the big boy on the block right now. It is gaining on everybody, and that is causing yields to rise and treasuries to fall at this point in time. Not severely, just.\n",
      "Enough to be noticed though, enough to note. 331.48 on Microsoft down 94 cents on the session right now. That's what we're at here. Keeping an eye on all of that info kids, all right. J.R. Sliden, Bobby. Good morning, Uncle Bruce and everybody. Hey, Mr. Atkinson, how you doing, buddy? Welcome to the show. 839 on SoFi down 20 cents, a little sell off this morning. We were 870 in the pre-market, we might go back there. I wouldn't be surprised if we did. We've got GameStop off 30 to 15.52 with the broader markets not gaining. Some of these stocks are gonna give up a few gains that they've had a few days, but I don't know how much. I don't know if SoFi will drop all that much because I don't think SoFi has to worry about interest rates going forward. They are growing that company leaps and bounds and we're gonna find out all about it on the 30th, the 18 days from now. J.R., down goes Tesla and up goes my green on an iron condor. Keep on trucking there, there you go, J.R., there it is. Those of you who've created iron condors, you don't mind a dip in the market. You don't mind if your stocks are fluctuating in a range. What do you care if you've got a $50 range on your stock or a 40, 50 point range on your indexes? You don't mind if they do this. Time goes by and these stocks or indexes don't go anywhere. Perfect for condor riders, I mean, just perfect. Shrinkage is yours, my friend, and it can pay you handsomely, absolutely handsomely. And why not take the dough? Absolutely right. You know, for some folks out there, if you can write 20 condors that have like a $5 spread, you don't even, you need less than 15 grand to do that. That's not a big account. And if you can do 20 condors at a time and you can bring in a buck and a half or $2 in credit on a 20 condor position, you know, at $2 a shot, that's 4,000 in credit. Now you close a condor out where there's only $1,000 cost to you, you keep three of the four grand and you can do that in say three weeks, that's 1,000 a week. You know, you do that every three weeks with another condor or another condor, you're making 1,000 a week. That for some of you out there is more than enough to quit your day job. That is more than enough to live off of your option shrinkage. Again, for those of you who are, you know, in your 40s and 50s and 60s, whether you were bought out by your employer or not, you have a way to build cash into your retirement account or into your savings through condors. For many of you out there who, you know, are just plugging along and are sitting on 401ks that you put together with your employer, you've been with the employer for many years, you may find that for some of you, you're in a position where you can take your 401k or a good chunk of it and self administer it through like your own IRA. And you might be able to do some option work with this. Might be worth your while. Now, for some of you out there, you have found out that you can borrow money against a 401k and it might be the perfect thing to do for taking care of either some very high expensive debt you've got, maybe credit card debt, or for some of you, you might find that listening to me talk about iron condors, you're sitting here going, you know, Bruce, I've taken your class, number 16, this iron condor credit spread class. And I'm thinking if I can get my hands on 20, 30, $40,000, I can write 10, 20 condors at a time on these triple Qs, on these SPYs, these trade tips you're handing out every day. These look juicy. I don't wanna write just one or two of these, I wanna write 20 of these. But if I can do a loan arrangement through my 401k, where I have a five-year payback program, I'm 48 years old, I'm working, I can keep making a payment every month to my 401k for the money I'm borrowing. The money I'm borrowing will be in my outside account, will be in my account not locked up inside a retirement plan. This is a cash I can get my hands on. Now, what I'd like to do is I'd like to borrow 40 grand, write 20 condors here and 20 more over there. And the revenue that I'm receiving from these condors will help me pay off the loan itself, number one. Number two, the additional revenue coming out from those condor rights are gonna knock off my credit card debt. I'm gonna just utilize this 30, $40,000 and make it make me the money to pay off these credit cards. Make it make me the money to pay off this last car loan. Or I have a car in the driveway that needs suspension work or it needs an engine rebuild and I don't have four or five grand lying around. Car and condors are gonna give me that four or five grand in the next couple of months and I'm gonna get the car fixed. Then I'm gonna sell that car for five, six, eight, 10, whatever I can get for it. And that will knock off a credit card or two or it's going to knock off the last 20 grand of my student loan that no government is gonna knock off for me. I gotta knock it off myself. I can get rid of payments and debts by making this kind of a move. So by going into debt against my own pension plan, my 401k, paying it back, that's the smart thing to do plus interest and utilizing that money to make money in the iron condor game, this is working for me. This is exactly where I wanna go. I wanna be involved in very conservative condor trades where the spreads are a mile wide and I'm taking out one grand a week, 1,500 every two weeks, three grand a month, whatever, adding it to my regular income and I'm getting ahead of these bills and debts that I have, which is lowering my cost of living every time I knock these debts off. It's a game changer and it really adds up. It adds up quickly. Bobby Atkinson, good morning. PukeBurb, how should I manage my iron condor for Nvidia? What am I gonna do with this Nvidia trade I've got? Well, let's see what we got. It's an October 21 expiry, 415 to 420 on the puts and 480 to 490 on the calls. I already rolled the puts, but I wonder if I should roll down the calls as well. Well, Nvidia right now is 469.10. So you're in a very good spot. I wouldn't touch the calls at all. I would leave them alone because you really only have $11 of pure coverage there. I know they die in nine days. So maybe Monday or Tuesday, they might be to the point where you're gonna close this one out completely and head over to November 17th and establish a new condor for this Nvidia with a wider spread. And of course, making sure that your calls are higher and your puts are nice and low with a nice wide spread. Keep the stock somewhere in the middle. That might be your game plan. We're up a dollar for Nvidia today. We're not going anywhere at this point, it seems, but just to be on the safe side, the Dow right now is trying to go up, but it's down right now 12, 15 points. So the Dow isn't going anywhere. That's not gonna be your problem. And the theory, I guess, is if the Dow and the S&P, we're gonna drop a half a percentage point today, Nvidia will likely drop four or $5, which means these calls will shrink down big time and your puts are so far away. Country, mile away. Beautiful stuff. But take a look at November 17th. Just get a pencil and paper out right now and do a calculation. Just pretend that you might close out this Nvidia trade shortly and put on a new one for November 17, the third Friday of November. And take a look at maybe the four, 15, 20 puts and maybe the four, five to five, 10 calls or five, 10 to five, 20 calls or five, 10 to five, 15 or five, 15, five, 20. Something a little wider because you wanna get a little further away from the 469. Just see what kind of credit can you get your hands on for a November 17 creation of a new condor. Now you can ask yourself, well, is it worth my while to close out the condor I have to take this one on now and go forward in time for the big moolah and the big credit and say, thank you for this.\n",
      "one. May I have another? Perhaps you can go with a $5 or a $10 spread on the new Condor and you can write more of them, create more of them. I don't know. Not a lurker anymore. Number 113. Hello everybody. Just sent you a confirmation for the meet and greet. Oh, beautiful stuff. They're coming up. We got folks coming to Sycacus, New Jersey. Giddy up everybody. We're looking forward to this. It's going to be a lot of fun. Looking forward for that meet and greet to happen. Yeah, NVIDIA. Let's see how it goes. Yeah. 31 point dip on the Dow right now, four on S&P, 15 on NASDAQ. So let's see what happens with this market. And way to go you guys on these trades that we were talking about the last several weeks. Way to go Gold Bagel members. Love it. And all of you Condor creators, well done. All righty. GameStop down 46 cents, SoFi down 27 right now. If you missed the opportunity to write cash secured puts on your SoFi, maybe now is your chance to do it and take in a nice credit. Might be the one. See what happens. Okay. All right. There you go, kids. Welcome one and all. We're up 70 on Apple still down a buck 13 on the Netflix and they'll be having a great day. Up 12.75. AI down 56 cents. NVIDIA is up a dollar 60 right here. Very interesting. 469.69. Tesla down 52 cents. You got Rocket Lab at 472 down 11. That's always a bargoon on your five. Matterport down three cents. Smart Rent down five. We got ATIP up nine at 809. Unity down 75. Google up 16. Moderna down a dollar. Cisco up 32. Pfizer, IBM, HBQ, Microsoft and you're all lower. Microsoft off by 90 now to 331.52. Amazon is off. Home Depot down. Vanik is up. Goldman is off. So is Boeing. They've gone into the red. Facebook up 20. Target up two bucks. JP Morgan kind of holding a one penny gain here. Costco up 198. Walmart up six. Disney down 24. American Airlines down 21. DraftKings down 48. AMC up one penny at 10.43. Royal Caribbean down a dollar to 88.18. There's your recap. Some of our more favorite stocks that we're following here at the moment. Thank you all so much for coming through here. We have 115 of the thumbs ups coming through. Thank you all. Keep those thumbs ups coming in. If you can find the button, hit it and add to the number. That would be terrific. Don't let Strickland catch you in the halls without having done a thumbs up. Well, we'll see how this all plays out here as the day wears on. Down 50 on the Dow. We've had, what, three, four up days in a row. So a little pullback. But this might be a dead cat pullback. Just a little old pullback and then another surge. The market is looking for an excuse to go higher. It wants to, but we'll see if this actually goes anywhere. All right. 4.35 on your SoFi. The low of the day on SoFi today. 8.28 was the low about 15-20 minutes ago. We're now back to 8.35 on SoFi. GameStop right now is off 38 at 15.44. The low of the day was 15.34. We've come back a dime on the GameStop. The volume, 296,000. Nothing, just nothing trading on the GameStop. We're down 59 on the Dow. So we're definitely red over there. Oil up 122 to 84.71. All right. Okay, kids. Welcome to the show and the party, everybody. Great to have you here. Down $1.10 on Microsoft. 3.31, 3.32. Okay. We're down 70 now on the Dow. Down 8 on S&P. Down 14 on NASDAQ. Little cell wave coming through here. All right. Fantastic. Great to see these emails coming in. We're coming out, Bruce. We're coming out. Right on. Right on. 116 thumbs ups. Thank you. Three more. All right. 97 point dip on the Dow at the moment. Down $4 on the Enphase to 124.36. GameStop, down 37 cents. So far down 23. S&P down 10 points. NASDAQ down 21 right now. Okay. Yeah, I was thinking about this the other day, that if you're able to write 20 to 40 iron condors, 20 to 40 at a time, and you're playing with really conservative time frames and very high spreads, and you can bring in, oh, $1 to $1.50 in credit for every condor you're creating, you do between 20 and 40 condors. You might do 20 of these and 20 of those or 10 and 10 and 10, whatever you want. If you can bring in that kind of credit on 40 condors, you're bringing in $4,000 to $6,000 in credit every time you create 40 condors. $4,000 to $6,000 in credit. And if the strategy is at the end of the month, through a month to roll over into new condors a month further out each time, like every month you're moving a month further up, bringing in another credit. You're buying back the condors for 50 cents that you sold for a buck and a half, scooping a dollar on 40 condors, that's 4,000, and then creating another series of 150 credit condors. This is how you get to the point where there's like four grand coming in every month from a new income earner. And it's your own money. You're putting your money to work like an 18 year old kid. And now $4,000 a month coming in the front door that wasn't coming in before starts to go towards these IOUs you've got lying around. They start disappearing in short order. For some of you out there, you're sitting on a whole bunch of these $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 IOUs all over the place. With four grand after three or four months of that, you've brought in $12,000 to $16,000. You have knocked off a bunch of these $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 IOUs. They're gone. They're eviscerated. And all of a sudden the heat is coming down on your life. The stress level on your finances is just dropping like a rock. And all you're doing is rolling over condors for a month forward every time with $50, $60, $80, $100 spreads on some of these stocks. Some of these indexes have very big spreads. You've got some massive spreads here that you can enjoy some real nice premium collection. I can't encourage you enough to look into it. It could be a game changer for many of you, especially those of you with less than $100,000 in your accounts, $50,000 or less. You could really get into some condor trades too. Again, conservative, widespread condors that can really make a difference. The shrinkage game will be your best friend. You don't own any stock. You don't own any deep in the money calls. You don't write covered calls all by yourself. You're just doing a condor. You're just doing condor after condor after condor and hauling in this money. You'll eventually run out of debt to pay off. It'll get to the point where the short-term debt you want to get rid of, you've done that. Credit cards are gone. Maybe your student loan has been knocked off. Maybe a car loan got eliminated or whatever these other loans are. All you have now is a mortgage. All you have is maybe a loan to yourself for your 401k, which you can prepay anytime you want if you can do that. Otherwise, you're just building your cash reserve to write more condors. You're going from 10 at a time to 15 at a time. As you're doing four different positions, you're writing 60 condors at a time on a rotating basis. Then you get to 80. Then you get to 100. And it's all natural. It's the same trade. It's the same positions. If you want to write spiders or Qs or Teslas or Apple condors, symbols are the same. The duration is the same. The spread is the same. It's just how many are you doing? It's all it is. This can take your finances to another level awful fast. There's no downside to this. You can go right into thousands of contract trades at a time if that's how far it's going to take you and take this more power to you. Absolutely more power to you. Maria, I'm looking at cash secured puts with this dip. That's what I'm looking for right now. Maybe this is\n",
      "This is it, 110, 111 point drop on the Dow. We're off nine on S&P, five on NASDAQ. We've got GameStop down 31 though. It's coming back on and SoFi's coming back. We're back to 844. So we're not giving up ground on those two anymore. They come in the other direction. The Q's are still up 41. The NASDAQ just isn't giving up as much ground. Spiders are down 87 cents. Enphase down 398, Spire down 13. The Dow up 108 at the moment. Apple up 122, Netflix down 82 cents. Adobe up 13, AI down 54, NVIDIA down, is up $4. NVIDIA is up four. Tesla up 23 cents, but Rocket Lab down 12, Matterport down three, SmartRent down six, Owens Corning down 340. ATIP up nine and Unity up 68 cents right here. We've got a lot of mixed quotes. Plus 15 on Google, negative 133 on Moderna, plus 17 on Cisco, negative 19 on Pfizer, IBM down 180, HPQ down 11, Microsoft down 92, ME down 47, Amazon up a dime, Home Depot down 430, Vantage is up 140, Goldman down 250, Boeing down 205, Meta down 69, Target up 188, JP Morgan down 59, Costco up 15, Walmart down 22, Disney down 60, American Airlines down 29, DraftKings down 53, AMC down 15 cents at the moment. There's your quick summary. A little of this, a little of that, a little of this, a little of that, so we got. All right, 840 on SoFi, 841 on SoFi down just 18 cents. GameStop 1549 down 33. All right, everyone. Welcome to the party, everybody. Welcome to the party. Good to see you all here today. Beautiful stuff. Let's see, good bunch of folks watched the Daily Trade today, and of course, the Trade Alert Show right on, appreciate that. And we're watching the rest of the channel, all the analytics, looking good, 120 thumbs ups. Thank you, 120. Thank you very much. All right, looking okay. Hmm, hmm, hmm. I noticed also that today, as I was saying to you earlier, the cost of living increase came through for Social Security, which is 3.2%. Let me ask you folks out there, are any of you folks out there experiencing 3.2% inflation in your lives? I think not. I don't think very many of you have got just 3.2% increase in cost of living where you are. I would bet you it's a lot higher than that, and yet millions and millions of Americans and a bunch of Canadians up here have to live off of their pensions, and they're only getting 3.2% when we all know it's much, it's probably double that, if not more than that. But it's not a darn thing you can do, but unless you've got another source of income, and this is why I keep talking about what we're doing here, even for seniors, seniors can haul money in from this market by writing options, absolutely. There are so many millions of people out there who don't know they can do this that are sitting on 50 to $250,000 of investments, and they're bringing in 4% a year after paying a 2% fee. They're bringing in 4% a year. Inflation is what, 3.2? Yeah, right, six, seven, eight, 10%. They're losing to inflation. They're losing against interest rates. Their investments aren't even paying what top CDs are paying, and they're being told they're doing great. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. If you're 48 years old, 50 years old, it's 55, and you've amassed a quarter million, that's supposed to become $1 million in the next five years, so you can live off of some of that, because when you retire, you gotta have over a million at your disposal. Aren't trying to, at 4%, 250 grand at 4%, you're only gonna get 10,000 a year in gains. Where is this 750,000 in gains coming from? You're not, you haven't got 75 years. I mean, 10 years from now, you've got 100,000 more. You got 350. How's that gonna get you to retirement comfortably? You're gonna eat that up in the first 10 years you're retired, then you're broke, because you're stuck now on social security. It's amazing how many there are, how many people there are that are stuck in this area where they're being told they're doing just fine. They're not doing just fine. They're underperforming the rest of the world out there, and they've got to improve this. Can you imagine if someone can take a quarter million and add 5% a month to that, instead of 8% a year, you know what I mean? You gotta grow these accounts to get a chance to retire. Maria, have a great day. Uncle Bruce and Auntie Jen, thank you. JJ, sounds like someone has taken advantage of news headlines. Well, what can I say? It's, it is what it is. Anyway, folks, I want to say thank you all for being with us again today. It's Bruce here from Zermatt. Auntie Jen is with Jen Jr. right now. They're out in Zermatt spending money. But thank you for being with us again today. I so appreciate your following us. We're off tomorrow, so no show tomorrow. Tomorrow is a day for Jen and I to spend with Jen Jr. Monday, we're traveling. We're heading to Munich on Monday. So that's a train day, we're off. But I'll be back on the air with you from Munich on Tuesday of next week. I think Tuesday, Wednesday, I'm on the air, and I believe it's Thursday we fly out to New York. So bear with us as we get over to the other side of the Atlantic latter part of next week. And then make sure to catch up with us on the 21st of October, Saturday at one in the afternoon at the Outback Steakhouse in Secaucus, New Jersey. There's only one Outback in Secaucus. Look it up, you'll find us there. PukeBerb, I was able to roll my NVIDIA Condor to November 18. I did a 410.25, a 550.60 without incurring any losses. Exactly, shouldn't have any of those. Nice move on that upper end to 550, that's really good. If in the next week or two, the stock sits where it is and backs off a little bit, you can bring those calls back down a little bit and you'll bring in credits. So yeah, nice going. I was able to do, yeah, 410 to 550, well, well done. All right, all right, good stuff. PukeBerb, well done, all right. Have a great day, everybody. Have a great weekend coming up, all of you. And we'll see you Tuesday from Munich. And I look forward to seeing you then and we'll keep you posted on how things are going. Take care of your loved ones. Give your special relatives extra long hugs. You never know when it's the last time, you never know. And we'll see you all on Tuesday from Munich. Okay, everybody, thank you so much for joining me today. All the best to you and you guys take care. Bye for now.\n",
